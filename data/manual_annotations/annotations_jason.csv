"Fundamental motor skills (FMS) are the basic building blocks of more complex, sport-specific skills and should be mastered at the end of early childhood; however, the relationship between the two has not yet been verified in prepubertal soccer players. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the role of FMS in a process of acquiring soccer-specific motor skills (measured using the speed dribbling) with regard to physical fitness and biological maturation. Forty soccer players (11.5 ± 0.3 years of age) at the highest performance level participated in the study. The role of FMS in a complex theoretical model with the relationships among physical fitness, biological maturation and speed dribbling was analyzed by multiple regression path analyses (MRPA). Moderate-to-strong correlations were found between FMS, physical fitness, and speed dribbling (r = 0.56 – 0.66). Moreover, biological maturation did not appear to be a significant predictor of physical fitness or speed dribbling. The MRPA model of physical fitness on speed dribbling with FMS as a mediator showed a significant indirect effect (standard estimation = -0.31, p = 0.001; R2 = 0.25). However, the direct correlation between physical fitness and speed dribbling was nonsignificant. Our results showed that FMS significantly strengthened the influence of physical fitness on the performance of speed dribbling, a soccer-specific motor skill, and thus played an important role in the process of the acquisition of sport-specific motor skills in prepubertal soccer players. Therefore, when considering the long-term training process, especially during childhood and before puberty, a wide range of FMS activities should be applied for better and possibly faster acquisition of soccer-specific motor skills.";1;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T15:29:24.422755Z;https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.00596;https://openalex.org/W2947570925;Childhood Motor Skills, Fine Motor Skills, Motor Skill Competence, Soccer Performance, Body Communication Skills;314.235;Developmental Perspective on Motor Skill Competence;Fundamental Motor Skills Mediate the Relationship Between Physical Fitness and Soccer-Specific Motor Skills in Young Soccer Players;2024-10-28T15:29:24.422775Z
"Objectives To evaluate the restart of the German Bundesliga (football (soccer)) during the COVID-19 pandemic from a medical perspective. Methods Participants were male professional football players from the two highest German leagues and the officials working closely with them. Our report covers nine match days spread over 9 weeks (May to July 2020). Daily symptom monitoring, PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA twice weekly, and antibody tests (on two occasions—early during the phase in May 2020 and in the week of the last match) were conducted. Target variables were: (1) onset of typical COVID-19 symptoms, (2) positive PCR results, and (3) IgG seroconversion against SARS-CoV-2. All detected seroconversions were controlled by neutralisation tests. Findings Suspicious symptoms were reported for one player; an immediate additional PCR test as well as all subsequent diagnostic and antibody tests proved negative for coronavirus. Of 1702 regularly tested individuals (1079 players, 623 officials members), 8 players and 4 officials tested positive during one of the first rounds of PCR testing prior to the onset of team training, 2 players during the third round. No further positive results occurred during the remainder of the season. 694 players and 291 officials provided two serum samples for antibody testing. Nine players converted from negative/borderline to positive (without symptoms); two players who initially tested positive tested negative at the end of the season. 22 players remained seropositive throughout the season. None of the seroconversions was confirmed in the neutralisation test. Conclusion Professional football training and matches can be carried out safely during the COVID-19 pandemic. This requires strict hygiene measures including regular PCR testing.";2;1;Medical / Injuries;2024-10-28T15:33:20.476319Z;https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2020-103150;https://openalex.org/W3087869109;Seroconversion, Football players, Football (Soccer);235.858;Diagnosis and Management of Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy;Successful return to professional men’s football (soccer) competition after the COVID-19 shutdown: a cohort study in the German Bundesliga;2024-10-28T15:33:20.476347Z
The objective of this study was to analyse the effect of the use of social networks in smartphones or playing video games on the passing decision-making performance in professional soccer athletes. Participants were 25 male professional soccer athletes (mean ± SD: age 23.4 ± 2.8 years). The participants performed three randomised conditions divided into three groups: control (CON), smartphone (SMA), and video game (VID). Before and after each experimental condition, the Stroop Task assessed the level of induced mental fatigue. Then, the athletes performed a simulated soccer match. A CANON® camera recorded the matches for further analysis on passing decision-making performance. A group effect was identified (p < .01) with impairment on passing decision-making performance for the SMA (p = .01, ES = 0.5) and VID (p = .01, ES = 0.5) conditions. We concluded that the use of social networks on smartphones and/or playing video games right before official soccer matches might impair the passing decision-making performance in professional soccer athletes.;3;1;Psychology;2024-10-28T15:33:52.198931Z;https://doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2020.1715181;https://openalex.org/W2999600067;Stroop effect, Soccer Performance, Athlete Monitoring, Training Load, Crossover study;31.533;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;The effect of smartphones and playing video games on decision-making in soccer players: A crossover and randomised study;2024-10-28T15:33:52.198945Z
"Abstract Current studies have reported high accuracy in global positioning system (GPS) and recently developed ultra‐wideband (UWB)‐based tracking systems for monitoring time – motion patterns. The accuracy and reliability of both systems may be different in tactical analysis application, an aspect that has never been studied previously. The aims of the present study were: (i) to determine and compare the accuracy of GPS and UWB technologies in soccer players’ positions (ii) to compare the tactical application of both systems. Following institutional ethical approval and familiarisation, 14 well‐trained soccer players performed tests around five courses: (a) field perimeter, (b) halfway line, (c) centre circle, (d) perimeter of the penalty area, and (e) semicircle penalty area. Also, a small‐sided game was played monitored with WIMUPRO™ to determine real and practical differences in accuracy of both systems in tactical analysis. For the GPS, the mean absolute error ( N = 9445) of “ x ” and “ y ” coordinates was 41.23 ± 17.31 cm and 47.6 ± 8.97 cm, respectively. For UWB, it was 9.57 ± 2.66 cm and 7.15 ± 2.62 cm. The results of the “ x ” and “ y ” accuracy comparison were significantly lower in all cases ( p &lt; 0.05) with an ES of 0.78 and 0.95, respectively. In a real practical application, the differences of both systems reached 8.31% in typical tactical variables (ES = 0.11). In contrast to GPS‐10Hz, UWB WIMUPRO™‐20 Hz has been demonstrated to be an acceptable technology to estimate the position of players on the pitch with high accuracy and be a useful, automatic, and portable instrument for tactical analysis measurement.";4;1;Tactics analysis;2024-10-28T20:34:40.838615Z;https://doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2019.1584248;https://openalex.org/W2930159046;Perimeter, Athlete Monitoring, Tracking (education), Position (finance), Tracking system;11.916;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;Comparing accuracy between global positioning systems and ultra-wideband-based position tracking systems used for tactical analyses in soccer;2024-10-28T20:34:40.838641Z

"Studies that examine the effects of inter-limb asymmetry on measures of physical performance are scarce, especially in adult female populations. The aim of the present study was to establish the relationship between inter-limb asymmetry and speed and change-of-direction speed (CODS) in adult female soccer players. Sixteen adult players performed a preseason test battery consisting of unilateral countermovement jump (CMJ), unilateral drop jump (DJ), 10 m, 30 m, and 505 CODS tests. Inter-limb asymmetry was calculated using a standard percentage difference equation for jump and CODS tests, and Pearson’s r correlations were used to establish a relationship between asymmetry and physical performance as well as asymmetry scores themselves across tests. Jump-height asymmetry from the CMJ (8.65%) and DJ (9.16%) tests were significantly greater (p &lt; 0.05) than asymmetry during the 505 test (2.39%). CMJ-height asymmetry showed no association with speed or CODS. However, DJ asymmetries were significantly associated with slower 10 m (r = 0.52; p &lt; 0.05), 30 m (r = 0.58; p &lt; 0.05), and 505 (r = 0.52–0.66; p &lt; 0.05) performance. No significant relationships were present between asymmetry scores across tests. These findings suggest that the DJ is a useful test for detecting existent between-limb asymmetry that might in turn be detrimental to speed and CODS performance. Furthermore, the lack of relationships present between different asymmetry scores indicates the individual nature of asymmetry and precludes the use of a single test for the assessment of inter-limb differences.";6;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T20:35:44.801810Z;https://doi.org/10.3390/sports7010029;https://openalex.org/W2912679289;Sprint, Fluctuating asymmetry, Soccer Performance, Athlete Monitoring, Vertical jump;17.054;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;Drop Jump Asymmetry is Associated with Reduced Sprint and Change-of-Direction Speed Performance in Adult Female Soccer Players;2024-10-28T20:35:44.801823Z
"The burden of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in professional soccer players is particularly relevant as it represents a potentially career-threatening injury.Our hypotheses were that (1) injury incidence rate would be similar to that reported in the literature, (2) we would identify a uniform distribution of the injuries along the season, and (3) injury incidence rate would be similar in high-ranked and lower ranked teams, based on final placement in the league.Descriptive epidemiological study.Level 4.Professional male soccer players participating in the Serie A championship league in 7 consecutive seasons (2011-2012 to 2017-2018) were screened to identify ACL injuries through the online football archive transfermarkt.com . Exposure in matches and training were calculated.There were 84 ACL injuries found (mean player age, 25.3 ± 4.2 years). Overall, 25% of ACL injuries were reruptures (15%) or contralateral injuries (10%). ACL incidence rate was 0.4215 per 1000 hours of play during Serie A matches, 0.0305 per 1000 hours of training (rate ratio [RR], 13.8; 95% CI, 8.4-22.7; P < 0.0001), and 0.0618 per 1000 hours of total play. Injury distribution had a bimodal peak, with the highest number of events in October and March. Alternatively, training injuries peaked in June and July. A significantly higher incidence rate was found for the teams ranked from 1st to 4th place compared with those ranked 5th to 20th (0.1256 vs 0.0559 per 1000 hours of play; RR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.4-3.6; P = 0.0003). A similar finding was found for injury incidence proportion (3.76% vs 1.64%; P = 0.0003).The overall incidence rate of ACL injuries in Italian Serie A was 0.062 per 1000 hours, with a 14-fold risk in matches compared with training. Relevantly, 25% were second injuries. Most injuries occurred in October and March, and an almost 2-fold incidence rate and incidence proportion were noted in those teams ranked in the first 4 positions of the championship league.Knowing the precise epidemiology of ACL injury in one of the most competitive professional football championship leagues could help delineate fields of research aimed to investigate its risk factors.";7;1;Medical / Injuries;2024-10-28T20:35:49.383366Z;https://doi.org/10.1177/1941738119885642;https://openalex.org/W2991833779;ACL injury, Anterior Cruciate Ligament, Injury Risk, Rate ratio, Sports Injury, Sports medicine;4.463;Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries in Athletes;Epidemiology of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury in Italian First Division Soccer Players;2024-10-28T20:35:49.383394Z
"This study examined the age-specific development of vertical jump height, straight and change-of-direction (COD) speed, and COD deficit in one-hundred and eighty-two elite soccer players from different age-categories (U15, U17, U20, and Senior). All participants were players of two distinct clubs and were undertaking different training routines, as planned by their technical staff members. For this purpose, the soccer players performed: (1) squat and countermovement jumps; (2) a maximal 20-m linear sprint speed test, and (3) the Zigzag COD test. The magnitude-based inference approach and standardized differences were used to compare the age-groups. Sprint speed at longer distances (20-m) increased progressively across the age-ranges. In contrast, speed and acceleration performances at shorter distances (5-m) were better in U15 than in the other age-categories. The COD speed did not change throughout the younger categories but presented a meaningful decrease in the Senior category. Surprisingly, despite the progressive increase in volume and intensity of neuromuscular training from younger to older categories, the COD deficit presented a gradual increase across the age-groups. It is possible that simple modulation of the strength-power training program during the maturation process is not sufficient to produce faster adult players with enhanced ability to change direction. Therefore, coaches are strongly encouraged to implement specific COD training practices to tolerate braking at increasing running speeds and appropriate volume and intensity of soccer specific training throughout the players’ specialization process.";8;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T20:35:56.155606Z;https://doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2019.1574276;https://openalex.org/W2914115112;Vertical jump, Soccer Performance, Athlete Monitoring, Club Head Speed;6.655;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;Change-of-direction, speed and jump performance in soccer players: a comparison across different age-categories;2024-10-28T20:35:56.155658Z
Introduction There is growing recognition of an association between contact sports participation and increased risk of neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer’s disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. In addition to cognitive impairment, a range of mental health disorders and suicidality are proposed as diagnostic features of traumatic encephalopathy syndrome, the putative clinical syndrome associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy. However, to date, epidemiological data on contact sport participation and mental health outcomes are limited. Methods For a cohort of former professional soccer players (n=7676) with known high neurodegenerative mortality and their matched general population controls (n=23 028), data on mental health outcomes were obtained by individual-level record linkage to national electronic records of hospital admissions and death certification. Results Compared with matched population controls, former professional soccer players showed lower risk of hospital admission for anxiety and stress related disorders, depression, drug use disorders, alcohol use disorders and bipolar and affective mood disorders. Among soccer players, there was no significant difference in risk of hospitalisation for mental health disorders between outfield players and goalkeepers. There was no significant difference in rate of death by suicide between soccer players and controls. Conclusions Among a population of former professional soccer players with known high neurodegenerative disease mortality, hospital admissions for common mental health disorders were lower than population controls, with no difference in suicide. Our data provide support for the reappraisal of currently proposed diagnostic clinical criteria for traumatic encephalopathy syndrome, in particular the inclusion of mental health outcomes.;9;1;Psychology;2024-10-28T20:36:00.167523Z;https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2020-323315;https://openalex.org/W3044790934;Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, Sports-related, Depression (economics);3.893;Epidemiology and Impact of Traumatic Brain Injury;Mental health and suicide in former professional soccer players;2024-10-28T20:36:00.167546Z
"Due to the negative effects that injuries have on performance, club finances, and long-term player health (permanent disability after a severe injury), prevention strategies are an essential part of both sports medicine and performance. Purpose: To summarize the current evidence regarding strength training for injury prevention in soccer and to inform its evidence-based implementation in research and applied settings. Conclusions: The contemporary literature suggests that strength training, proposed as traditional resistance, eccentric, and flywheel training, may be a valid method to reduce injury risk in soccer players. Training strategies involving multiple components (eg, a combination of strength, balance, plyometrics) that include strength exercises are effective at reducing noncontact injuries in female soccer players. In addition, the body of research currently published supports the use of eccentric training in sports, which offers unique physiological responses compared with other resistance exercise modalities. It seems that the Nordic hamstring exercise, in particular, is a viable option for the reduction of hamstring injuries in soccer players. Moreover, flywheel training has specific training peculiarities and advantages that are related to the combination of both concentric and eccentric contraction, which may play an important role in injury prevention. It is the authors' opinion that strength and conditioning coaches should integrate the strength training methods proposed here in their weekly training routine to reduce the likelihood of injuries in their players; however, further research is needed to verify the advantages and disadvantages of these training methods to injury prevention using specific cohorts of soccer players.";10;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T20:36:10.096491Z;https://doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2020-0862;https://openalex.org/W3119196131;Plyometrics, Eccentric training, Strength training, Modalities, Training Load, Soccer Performance, Sports medicine, Sports Injury, Injury Prevention, Athletic training, Match play, Hamstring injury;9.809;Epidemiology of Sports-Related Musculoskeletal Injuries;Implementing Strength Training Strategies for Injury Prevention in Soccer: Scientific Rationale and Methodological Recommendations;2024-10-28T20:36:10.096518Z
"The present study aimed to investigate whether the form and amount of declarative tactical knowledge (DTK) and procedural tactical knowledge (PTK) influence cognitive effort during soccer performance among young players. We assessed 36 male players from a Brazilian first-division soccer club; participants averaged 14.89 ( SD = 1.42) years of age. We evaluated DTK from video simulation tests and PTK through the System of Tactical Assessment in Soccer. We assessed cognitive effort by measures of pupil diameter using Mobile Eye Tracking-XG while players viewed soccer video scenes and made game-related play decisions. After the assessment of tactical knowledge, we categorized the sample according to players' tactical knowledge into participants with higher and lower PTK and higher and lower DTK. Subsequently, we examined the both PTK and DTK groups on cognitive effort. Our results suggest that tactical knowledge influences cognitive effort in that players with higher PTK and DTK displayed less cognitive effort during soccer performance tasks. In conclusion, we observed that PTK and DTK influenced the cognitive effort younger soccer players expended while viewing soccer scenes and making soccer performance decisions.";11;1;Psychology;2024-10-28T20:36:39.975771Z;https://doi.org/10.1177/0031512519826437;https://openalex.org/W2914387741;Soccer Performance, Sport Psychology, Coaching Effectiveness, Youth Sport Specialization;29.756;Development of Expert Performance in Sports Psychology;Young Soccer Players With Higher Tactical Knowledge Display Lower Cognitive Effort;2024-10-28T20:36:39.975790Z
Physical exercise strongly affects human metabolism and causes biochemical changes. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between routine plasma biomarker levels and recovery efficiency in soccer players during an entire competitive match season. The players participating in the study were divided into a midfielder/defender group (seven midfielders and seven defenders) and a goalie/substitute group (six persons-goalkeepers and players with a short cumulative match-time). The fasting capillary blood samples were taken 17-24 h after each competitive match. The blood plasma was used to determine the creatinine, urea, alkaline phosphatase, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate and alanine aminotransferase, iron and magnesium levels of the athletes. The levels of (AST) (aspartate aminotransferase), (ALT) (alanine aminotransferase) and (Cr) creatinine were higher in the midfielder/defender group than in the control group, but only AST and Cr significantly varied over time (AST decreased, and Cr increased with time). The (LDH) (lactate dehydrogenase) activity and urea level were significantly lower in the midfielder/defender group than in the goalie/substitute group, and it significantly varied over time (LDH decreased, and urea increased with time). No differences in the (CK) creatine kinase and (ALP) alkaline phosphatase activities between the groups was found, although CK increased significantly with time in the midfielder/defender group (particularly midfielders in the spring round). In midfielders, the AST activity and the iron level were significantly lower in the spring than in the autumn round. On the contrary, ALT, CK, urea and magnesium levels were significantly higher in the spring than in autumn round. A long-term measurement of biochemical parameters in elite soccer players indicated that AST, CK, LDH and creatinine levels, when analyzed together, could constitute a useful set of markers for monitoring recovery periods.;12;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T20:36:46.496793Z;https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16183279;https://openalex.org/W2971859995;Soccer Performance, Athlete Monitoring, Inflammatory Effects of Exercise, Metabolism, Performance Analysis;6.399;The Role of Exercise in Inflammation and Oxidative Stress;Blood Biomarkers of Recovery Efficiency in Soccer Players;2024-10-28T20:36:46.496807Z

J Strength Cond Res 33(10): 2622–2628, 2019—The purpose of this study was to evaluate effects of training load (TL) on performance and biomarkers of health, performance, and recovery in Division I female soccer players throughout a competitive season. Subjects ( N = 25, M age = 20 ± 1.1 years) were monitored before the start of preseason and every 4-weeks thereafter (T1–T5). A battery of performance tests was administered before the start of preseason (P1) and end-of-season (P2), including body composition (percent body fat [%BF], fat free mass [FFM], and fat mass), vertical jump (VJ), and V o 2 max. Blood draws were conducted at every time point (T1–T5) to assess free and total cortisol (CORTF and CORTT), prolactin (PRL), T3, IL-6, creatine kinase (CK), sex-hormone binding globulin, omega-3 (n-3FA), vitamin-D (Vit-D), iron (Fe), hematocrit (HcT), ferritin (Fer), percent saturation (%Sat), and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC). Daily exercise energy expenditure (EEE) and TL were determined. There were significant declines in V o 2 max, VJ, weight, and %BF from P1–P2 ( p &lt; 0.05) with no significant differences in FFM. Training load and EEE significantly decreased from T1–T3 ( p &lt; 0.05). Significant increases were seen in CORTT, CORTF, PRL, T3, IL-6, CK, and TIBC throughout the season ( p &lt; 0.05). Significant decreases were seen in n-3FA, Fe, Fer, %Sat, and Hct throughout the season ( p &lt; 0.05).

The purpose of this study was to analyze the mechanism of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries among male and female high school students across several different sports to understand ACL injury trends.A total of 1000 cases involving high school students who suffered ACL injuries during school activities (soccer, basketball, volleyball, handball, and judo) and who received insurance benefits through the Injury and Accident Mutual Aid Benefit System, were included to clarify the various mechanisms of ACL injuries. The mechanism of ACL injury was divided into contact and non-contact injuries. Contact injuries were further divided into direct and indirect contact injuries. Non-contact ACL injuries were also further divided into landing injuries, which involved jump-landing movements, and cutting and stopping injuries, which involved movement with a change of direction and deceleration.Overall, 99.0% of judo ACL injuries were categorized as contact ACL injuries. With regards to ball sports, the number of non-contact ACL injuries among basketball, volleyball, and handball players was significantly higher than the number of contact injuries (67.0%, 86.5%, and 68.5% respectively). With regards to female soccer and basketball players, the number of indirect ACL injuries was higher than direct injuries (72.2% and 76.7%, respectively).Volleyball was associated with a higher rate of non-contact injuries. Soccer, basketball, and handball were associated with more or similar rates of indirect and non-contact injuries than direct injuries. Judo was associated with a higher rate of contact injuries.;14;1;Medical / Injuries;2024-10-28T20:37:01.909526Z;https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000016030;https://openalex.org/W2954040407;Basketball, ACL injury, Body contact, Injury Risk, Anterior Cruciate Ligament;6.382;Epidemiology of Sports-Related Musculoskeletal Injuries;A retrospective study of mechanisms of anterior cruciate ligament injuries in high school basketball, handball, judo, soccer, and volleyball;2024-10-28T20:37:01.909559Z
"Bio-banded competition has been introduced to address the variation in physical maturity within soccer. To date, no research has investigated the effect of bio-banded competition relative to chronological competition. The current study investigated the effect of bio-banding upon physical and technical performance in elite youth soccer athletes. Twenty-five male soccer athletes (11–15 years) from an English Premier League soccer academy participated in bio-banded and chronological competition, with physical and technical performance data collected for each athlete. Athletes were between 85–90% of predicted adult stature, and sub-divided into early, on-time and late developers. For early developers, significantly more short passes, significantly less dribbles and a higher rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were evident during bio-banded competition compared to chronological competition (p &lt; 0.05). Significantly more short passes and dribbles, and significantly fewer long passes were seen for on-time developers during bio-banded competition (p &lt; 0.05). For late developers, significantly more tackles, and significantly fewer long passes were evident during bio-banded competition (p &lt; 0.05). No significant differences in physical performance were identified between competition formats. Results demonstrated that bio-banded competition changed the technical demand placed upon athletes compared to chronological competition, without reducing the physical demands.

The aim of the study was to examine the effects of a detraining period (DTP) (i.e., off-season) with an individually prescribed training program, and a retraining period (RTP) (i.e., pre-season) combining soccer and flywheel-based strength training on fat-free mass (FFM) and fat-mass (FM) in 10 elite professional male soccer players. The present study used a controlled repeated-measures research design to investigate the changes in FFM and FM using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Whole body %FM increased (effect size (ES) = 0.87 ± 0.46) and FFM reduced after DTP (ES = -0.30 ± 0.19), returning to values comparable to the end of the previous season after RTP. At regional levels, arms, legs, and trunk %FM increased (ES = from 0.42 to 1.29) while trunk-FFM was reduced (ES = -0.40 ± 0.26) after DTP, returning to the values observed at the end of the previous season after RTP. Legs-FFM did not change after DTP, with a substantial increase after RTP in comparison with pre-season values (ES = 0.34 ± 0.29 and 0.53 ± 0.36 for the right and left leg, respectively). Despite the small sample size of the present study, the findings indicate that elite soccer players can be allowed 2 weeks of rest during a five-week DTP, since the changes in %FM and FFM were relatively small, and FM and FFM returned to the optimal initial values for competition after the proposed RTP during the pre-season.;16;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T20:38:31.646159Z;https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.7466;https://openalex.org/W2968430922;Fat free mass, Training Load, Muscle Adaptations, Athlete Monitoring;65.196;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;The effects of detraining and retraining periods on fat-mass and fat-free mass in elite male soccer players;2024-10-28T20:38:31.646173Z
"The presence of spectators in sport is considered a factor that leads to home advantage (HA). The objective of this research was to analyse the difference of wins, points and goals both at home and away depending on the presence or absence of a crowd and other possible covariates such as budget or average attendance at the stadium in times post COVID. The sample is made up of eight football leagues (soccer) from Germany, Spain, Italy, England and Austria. The results show that there are no significant differences between playing with or without a crowd, except in the German and Spanish top leagues. Even so, there is a tendency in most competitions to play worse at home and better away from home when there are no spectators. These findings do not generally support the theory of social facilitation; so it is concluded that there must be other factors that explain HA.";17;1;Other;2024-10-28T20:39:04.656891Z;https://doi.org/10.1080/14660970.2020.1830067;https://openalex.org/W3091881834;Stadium, Attendance, Sample (material), Spectator Behavior;32.882;Economics of Professional Sports and Prediction Markets;Home advantage in European soccer without crowd;2024-10-28T20:39:04.656915Z
"Brazil is the leading global exporter of soccer players, with approximately 2,000 international transfers to different clubs per year. Although Brazilian players compete in the most prestigious soccer leagues worldwide, the habitual training methods, strategies, and routines of Brazilian soccer strength and conditioning coaches (SCCs) are undocumented. This study used a standard online survey to collect and characterize the strength and conditioning practices of Brazilian soccer SCCs. Forty-nine SCCs (age: 40.4 ± 7.5 years; professional experience: 15.3 ± 7.5 years) working in Brazilian professional soccer teams participated in this study. The survey consisted of eight sections: 1) background information; 2) muscular strength-power development; 3) speed training; 4) plyometrics; 5) flexibility training; 6) physical testing; 7) technology use; and 8) programing. Results indicated that training and testing practices of Brazilian SCCs are strongly affected by the congested fixture schedules, extensive traveling distances, and socio-economic disparities between different regions of the country. We describe all these different strategies and methods in detail, providing a comprehensive view and a critical examination of Brazilian soccer strength and conditioning practices. Brazilian SCCs and professional soccer organizations can use the findings from this study to develop training strategies and customize education programs. Practitioners from other countries can use this information to design training programs closely tailored to the background of Brazilian athletes, which may support their adaptation to different competitive scenarios and game demands, such as those found in the most important soccer leagues worldwide.";18;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T20:40:52.977318Z;https://doi.org/10.5114/biolsport.2022.108703;https://openalex.org/W3203966018;Plyometrics, Soccer Performance, Coaching Effectiveness, Training Load, Elite;108.18;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;Practices of strength and conditioning coaches in Brazilian elite soccer;2024-10-28T20:40:52.977341Z

Talent identification (TID) and development (TDE) are large fields in professional soccer and in science. However, TID and TDE processes in youth academies have not been assessed in detail. As such, our aim was to survey professional clubs from around the world about their youth academy TID and TDE processes, with 29 clubs responding to the survey. TID and TDE processes changed as a function of player age. TID processes involved finding the best players locally and regionally, but for older players the search widened to nationally and internationally for the needs of the first team. Clubs used a multidisciplinary approach to TID, but more so with older players. Median number of academy players was 80, 100, and 66 players at 8-11 years, 12-16 years, and 17-21 years, respectively. Annual player turnover in the most recent season (selections/de-selections) was 29% across all age groups, with competition from other clubs cited as a limitation to TID. TDE processes involved weekly matches and 3-5 training sessions per week led by experienced, well-qualified coaches, with most clubs providing players with academic education, residency and transportation services. Our findings extend previous research assessing professional soccer youth academy TID and TDE processes by quantifying worldwide practices.;20;1;Scouting / Finance;2024-10-28T20:42:25.100432Z;https://doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2020.1752440;https://openalex.org/W3022645290;Identification (biology), Athlete Development, Youth Sport Specialization, Coaching Effectiveness, Training Load, Team sport;10.864;Development of Expert Performance in Sports Psychology;A survey of talent identification and development processes in the youth academies of professional soccer clubs from around the world;2024-10-28T20:42:25.100451Z
"Abstract In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced most activities in Italy, including soccer, to cease. During lockdown, players could only train at home, with limited evidence regarding the effect of this period. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of COVID-19 lockdown on professional soccer players’ physical performance. Aerobic fitness and vertical jump were assessed before and after four periods in two different seasons: COVID-19 lockdown, competitive period before lockdown, competitive period and summer break of the 2016–2017 season. Linear mixed models were used to examine within-period changes and between-period differences in changes observed during COVID-19 lockdown and the three other periods. Within-period changes in aerobic fitness showed a significant improvement following COVID-19 lockdown (p&lt;0.001) and a significant decline during summer break (p&lt;0.001). Between-period differences were significant in the comparison of COVID-19 lockdown with both the competitive 2019–2020 season (p&lt;0.01) and summer break (p&lt;0.001). For the vertical jump, only the between-period comparison revealed significant differences as the changes associated with COVID-19 lockdown were worse than those of the two competitive periods, for both absolute (p&lt;0.05; p&lt;0.001) and relative peak power (p&lt;0.01; p&lt;0.001). Home-based training during lockdown was effective to improve aerobic fitness, although it did not allow players to maintain their competitive period’s power levels.";21;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T20:42:31.848091Z;https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1345-9262;https://openalex.org/W3131867086;Aerobic exercise, Athlete Monitoring, 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak;6.629;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on Serie A Soccer Players’ Physical Qualities;2024-10-28T20:42:31.848105Z
Creativity is one of the key parts of expert performance in sport and other domains. The aim of this study was to determine the underlying perceptual and cognitive processes that underpin creative expert performance in the sport of soccer. Forty skilled adult soccer players participated. In the experimental task, they interacted with representative video-based 11 vs. 11 attacking situations whilst in possession of a ball. Clips were occluded at a key moment and participants were required to play the ball in response to each presented scenario as they would in a real-game situation. Moreover, they were required to name other additional actions they could execute for each situation. Their solutions on the task were measured using the three observation criteria for creativity of originality, flexibility, and fluency of decisions. Using these criteria, players were categorized into either high- or low-creative groups. Visual search and cognitive thought processes were recorded during the task using a portable eye-movement registration system and retrospective verbal reports. The creativity-based between-group differences in decision making were underpinned by differences in visual search strategy. Compared to the low-creative group, the high-creative players made more fixations of shorter duration in a different sequential order and to more task-relevant locations of the display, indicating a broader attentional focus. They also generated a greater number of verbal reports of thoughts related to the assessment of the current task situation and planning of future decisions when compared with the low-creative players. Our findings highlight the perceptual-cognitive processes that underlie creative expert performance in a sport-specific domain.;22;1;Psychology;2024-10-28T20:42:38.158766Z;https://doi.org/10.1007/s00426-020-01320-5;https://openalex.org/W3012834065;Sport Psychology, Soccer Performance, Coaching Effectiveness, Expert Performance, Performance Analysis, Cognitive flexibility;6.196;Development of Expert Performance in Sports Psychology;Perceptual-cognitive processes underlying creative expert performance in soccer;2024-10-28T20:42:38.158806Z
Background: Agility in general and change-of-direction speed (CoD) in particular represent important performance determinants in elite soccer. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of a 6-week neuromuscular training program on agility performance, and to determine differences in movement times between the slower and faster turning directions in elite soccer players. Materials and Methods: Twenty male elite soccer players from the Stade Rennais Football Club (Ligue 1, France) participated in this study. The players were randomly assigned to a neuromuscular training group (NTG, n=10) or an active control (CG, n=10) according to their playing position. NTG participated in a 6-week, twice per week neuromuscular training program that included CoD, plyometric and dynamic stability exercises. Neuromuscular training replaced the regular warm-up program. Each training session lasted 30 minutes. CG continued their regular training program. Training volume was similar between groups. Before and after the intervention, the two groups performed a reactive agility test that included 180° left and right body rotations followed by a 5-m linear sprint. The weak side was defined as the left/right turning direction that produced slower overall movement times (MT). Reaction time (RT) was assessed and defined as the time from the first appearance of a visual stimulus until the athlete's first movement. Results: No significant between-group baseline differences were observed for RT or MT. Significant group x time interactions were found for MT (p=0.012, effect size = 0.332, small) for the slower and faster directions (p=0.011, effect size = 0.627, moderate). Significant pre-to post improvements in MT were observed for NTG but not CG (p=0.011, effect size = 0.877, moderate). For NTG, post-hoc analyses revealed significant MT improvements for the slower (p=0.012, effect size = 0.897, moderate) and faster directions (p=0.017, effect size = 0.968, moderate). Conclusions: Our results illustrate that 6 weeks of neuromuscular training with 2 sessions per week included in the warm-up program, significantly enhanced agility performance in elite soccer players. Moreover, improvements were found on both sides during body rotations. Thus, practitioners are advised to focus their training programs on both turning directions.;23;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T20:42:45.231892Z;https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.00947;https://openalex.org/W2960284616;Sprint, Training Load, Plyometrics, Exercise Capacity, Soccer Performance, High-Intensity Interval Training, Muscle Adaptations;6.956;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;Effects of Neuromuscular Training on Agility Performance in Elite Soccer Players;2024-10-28T20:42:45.231909Z
Abstract The purpose of the study was to examine how various playing positions affected the number of (and percentage breakdowns for) physical and technical activities of soccer players in the Germany’s Bundesliga. A further objective was to identify and present features distinguishing between the activities of players within the Defender, Midfielder and Forward formations. The study sample comprised 4426 individual match observations of 473 soccer players competing in the Bundesliga during the 2016/2017 domestic season. Data from the Impire AG motion analysis system, and the so-called ”heat maps” it supplies, revealed areas in which players spent most time during a match, with 22 different playing positions on the pitch identified in consequence. Players in the formation comprising Defenders did not differ significantly in relation to the number of accelerations, the number of shots or the percentage of duels won. Furthermore, there were no significant differences among Midfielders in regard to total distance covered, mean running speed, the number of accelerations, the number of duels and the percentage of duels won. Likewise, Forwards did not differ in distances covered at ≥24 km/h, average running speed, the number of sprints, the number of shots, the proportion of on-target passes, the number of duels, or the percentage share of duels won. Irrespective of the formation or position on the pitch, today’s game of soccer also pays great importance to the number of accelerations, as well as the number of duels engaged in, and their effectiveness.;24;1;Innovative Technologies;2024-10-28T20:42:56.285304Z;https://doi.org/10.2478/hukin-2018-0067;https://openalex.org/W2928623340;Soccer Performance, Performance Analysis, Athlete Monitoring;10.925;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;A New Approach to the Analysis of Pitch-Positions in Professional Soccer;2024-10-28T20:42:56.285329Z
"Abstract Castillo, D, Raya-González, J, Weston, M, and Yanci, J. Distribution of external load during acquisition training sessions and match play of a professional soccer team. J Strength Cond Res 35(12): 3453–3458, 2021—The aim of this study was to use global position systems to analyze the external loads of the 3 different acquisition training sessions (ATS) with competitive matches in professional soccer players over a 6-week period. Sixteen professional soccer players participated in the study, which analyzed the distribution of external load during the training microcycle of a professional soccer team. The 3 types of ATS undertaken by the players were as follows: ATS1 (strength), ATS2 (endurance), and ATS3 (speed). The total distance covered, the distance covered at above 14 km·h −1 , the distance covered &gt;21 km·h −1 , the number of high accelerations (&gt;3 m·s −2 ), and player load were recorded. The results showed that external loads were consistently higher during matches when compared with all training sessions (range of effect sizes: 1.06–3.38). Between training session comparisons revealed higher external loads during ATS1 and ATS2, when compared with ATS3 (range of effect sizes: 0.60–2.41). The only external load variable that differed between ATS1 and ATS2 was the distance covered &gt;21 km·h −1 , which was higher for ATS1.

"Objectives The risk of viral transmission associated with contact sports such as football (soccer) during the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown. The aim of this study was to describe the infective and immune status of professional football players, team staff and league officials over a truncated football season resumed at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in a country with high infection rates and to investigate the clinical symptoms related to COVID-19 infection in professional football players. Methods Prospective cohort study of 1337 football players, staff and officials during a truncated football season (9 weeks) with a tailored infection control programme based on preventive measures and regular SARS-CoV-2 PCR swab testing (every 3–5 days) combined with serology testing for immunity (every 4 weeks). Clinical symptoms in positive participants were recorded using a 26-item, Likert-Scale-based scoring system. Results During the study period, 85 subjects returned positive (cycle threshold (cT) ≤30) or reactive (30&lt;cT&lt;40) PCR tests, of which 36 were players. The infection rate was consistent with that of the general population during the same time period. More than half of infected subjects were asymptomatic, and the remaining had only mild symptoms with no one requiring hospitalisation. Symptom severity was associated with lower cT values. Social contacts and family were the most common sources of infection, and no infection could be traced to training or matches. Of the 36 infected players, 15 presented positive serology during the study period. Conclusion Football played outdoors involving close contact between athletes represents a limited risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe illness when preventive measures are in place.";26;1;Other;2024-10-28T20:43:18.627213Z;https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2020-103724;https://openalex.org/W3131824226;Pandemic, Football players, Football (Soccer), Herd immunity;6.896;Diagnosis and Management of Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy;Resuming professional football (soccer) during the COVID-19 pandemic in a country with high infection rates: a prospective cohort study;2024-10-28T20:43:18.627226Z
An increasing number of female soccer players are playing at the elite level. It is important to encourage these players to remain mindful of the benefits of carrying out a dual career (e.g., higher education and elite sport path). The current study provides an investigation of players’ dual career plans and the demands they encounter. The guiding framework used within the research was the Push–Pull theoretical framework. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 11 participants, encapsulating a variety of players at differing stages of their academic/vocational development. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis. All but 1 player in compulsory and secondary education were found to have a desire to carry out higher education, with 3 of these players planning to attend university in America. The main reason given by players for planning to continue education was to “have something to fall back on.” Dual career difficulty was found to increase as players’ level of education increased (i.e., from school to university and from university to vocation). Suitable support systems (e.g., university support, family support) were found to play an integral role in the dual career demands faced by participants, with players receiving varying levels of support from their educational institutions and soccer clubs. This article advances previous work on the dual careers of athletes, focusing specifically on English women’s soccer during a period of key change within the governing body.Lay summary: We explored the decisions of and demands faced by female soccer players as they strive to combine work/education with their sporting commitments during a time of a change within The Football Association.

"Performance analysis in soccer has attained greater importance for coaching staff in order to gather and manage useful information (i.e., physical, technical, and tactical) of their teams during consecutive seasons. Accordingly, we examined the evolution of physical and technical performance parameters in the Chinese Soccer Super League (CSL). Data were collected from 1,429 CSL matches from the 2012 season to the 2017 season using the Amisco Pro (Amisco, Nice, France) system. Fourteen technical performance-related indicators and 11 physical performance-related indicators were analysed using a mixed linear model for repeated measures. Significant main effects of season were followed up using the Bonferroni correction (multiple comparisons). Although there were some irregularities, performance variables generally showed significant upward trends across the six seasons (p<0.05), resulting in significant increases from the 2012 season to the 2017 season in the total sprint distance (2,069.7±509.3 m vs. 2,272±493.6 m; p<0.001; effect size [ES]: 0.40), number of sprints (100.1±22.8 vs. 104.8±20.8, p<0.001; ES: 0.22), high-speed distance (2568.4±503.5 m vs. 2823.1±479.2 m; (p<0.001; ES: 0.52), and high-speed effort (187.5±36.1 to 204.7±33.7; p<0.001; ES: 0.49). Furthermore, there were ~23% more crosses (p<0.001; ES: 0.45), ~12% more shots on target (p<0.001; ES: 0.22), and ~11% more opponent penalty area entries (p<0.001; ES: 0.20) during the 2017 season than in the 2012 season. Coaches and sports scientists should be mindful of this evolution when preparing training sessions and recruiting new players, and even when predicting future trends in the Chinese Soccer Super League.";28;1;Tactics analysis;2024-10-28T20:45:37.036680Z;https://doi.org/10.5114/biolsport.2020.93039;https://openalex.org/W3007236098;Athlete Monitoring, Performance Analysis, Soccer Performance;119.519;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;The evolution of physical and technical performance parameters in the Chinese Soccer Super League;2024-10-28T20:45:37.036764Z
Tracking objects in soccer videos is extremely important to gather both player and team statistics, whether it is to estimate the total distance run, the ball possession or the team formation. Video processing can help automating the extraction of those information, without the need of any invasive sensor, hence applicable to any team on any stadium. Yet, the availability of datasets to train learnable models and benchmarks to evaluate methods on a common testbed is very limited. In this work, we propose a novel dataset for multiple object tracking composed of 200 sequences of 30s each, representative of challenging soccer scenarios, and a complete 45-minutes half-time for long-term tracking. The dataset is fully annotated with bounding boxes and tracklet IDs, enabling the training of MOT baselines in the soccer domain and a full benchmarking of those methods on our segregated challenge sets. Our analysis shows that multiple player, referee and ball tracking in soccer videos is far from being solved, with several improvement required in case of fast motion or in scenarios of severe occlusion.;29;1;Innovative Technologies;2024-10-28T20:45:47.409235Z;https://doi.org/10.1109/cvprw56347.2022.00393;https://openalex.org/W4292828369;Multiple Object Tracking, Object Tracking, Benchmarking, Visual Tracking, Real-time Tracking, Soccer Video, Testbed, Benchmark (surveying);10.225;Visual Object Tracking and Person Re-identification;SoccerNet-Tracking: Multiple Object Tracking Dataset and Benchmark in Soccer Videos;2024-10-28T20:45:47.409244Z
Decision-making is a critical aspect of soccer referees’ performance. Yet current training methods that simulate the refereeing task are limited. Skilled soccer referees ( N = 22, M age = 27.14 years, SD = 6.40) were tested on a new decision-making simulator during the active part of the season. They ran on a treadmill for 60 min at varying paces while watching two video sections depicting real matches, in context and in mixed order, and called their match decisions out loud. They completed pre- and post-test assessments of their feelings and perceived exertion, and a post-test assessment of their performance. The referees reported positive feelings prior to and following the test, and rated their performance favourably. They felt the simulator was moderately representative of a real match, and their perceived exertion increased progressively during the test. Decision accuracy levels were higher for simple decisions, such as out of play (73.81%), than for careless fouls (62.86%) or yellow/red cards (25.97%). Decision accuracy levels for yellow/red cards decisions were significantly higher in the in-context section (28.91%) than in the mixed section (20.83%). Decision accuracy levels peaked in the third quarter and decreased during the final quarter. Self-control during the test correlated moderately with overall accuracy. Careless foul decision accuracy was on par with previous studies, supporting the simulator’s validity. The findings support the use of the simulator as a potentially innovative method for training referees in sequential decision-making.;30;1;Other;2024-10-28T20:45:59.944981Z;https://doi.org/10.1177/1747954119858696;https://openalex.org/W2965223370;Soccer Performance, Sport Psychology, Coaching Effectiveness, Referee Bias, Training Load, Treadmill;12.382;Development of Expert Performance in Sports Psychology;A decision-making simulator for soccer referees;2024-10-28T20:45:59.944999Z
Decision-making (DM) is a critical aspect of soccer refereeing. Referees make numerous repetitive decisions, many of which are dependent on appropriate field location and effective interaction with their assistants. Considering the complexity of the sequential DM process, it is not surprising that referees exhibit high decision error rates. Most extant research has focused on the underlying mechanism of the DM process as well as on various influential factors. Less attention has been given to models that consider the range of influential factors which affect the DM process. This article, therefore, presents a new conceptual framework of sequential DM for soccer referees that relies on Tenenbaum’s (2003. Expert athletes: An integrated approach to decision making. In J. Starkes & A. Ericsson (Eds.), Expert performance in sports: Advances in research on sport expertise (pp. 191–218). Human Kinetics) conceptual framework and the existing literature. We start by reviewing research on DM in soccer refereeing and then discuss conceptual considerations. We then present the new conceptual framework. This model incorporates a range of factors, including physical fitness and fatigue, field positioning, visual attention, contextual factors, game management, expertise, psychological factors, and team factors. Data obtained from a sample of 20 elite referees and assistants demonstrated the face validity of the new model. Finally, we introduce implications for training referees’ DM skills and highlight avenues for future research and conceptual developments.;31;1;Other;2024-10-28T20:46:10.844699Z;https://doi.org/10.1080/1612197x.2020.1766539;https://openalex.org/W3028261289;Conceptual framework, Conceptual model, Referee Bias, Sport Psychology, Coaching Effectiveness;10.742;Development of Expert Performance in Sports Psychology;An integrated conceptual framework of decision-making in soccer refereeing;2024-10-28T20:46:10.844726Z
In the derived approach, an analysis is performed on Twitter data for World Cup soccer 2014 held in Brazil to detect the sentiment of the people throughout the world using machine learning techniques. By filtering and analyzing the data using natural language processing techniques, sentiment polarity was calculated based on the emotion words detected in the user tweets. The dataset is normalized to be used by machine learning algorithms and prepared using natural language processing techniques like word tokenization, stemming and lemmatization, part-of-speech (POS) tagger, name entity recognition (NER), and parser to extract emotions for the textual data from each tweet. This approach is implemented using Python programming language and Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). A derived algorithm extracts emotional words using WordNet with its POS (part-of-speech) for the word in a sentence that has a meaning in the current context, and is assigned sentiment polarity using the SentiWordNet dictionary or using a lexicon-based method. The resultant polarity assigned is further analyzed using naïve Bayes, support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and random forest machine learning algorithms and visualized on the Weka platform. Naïve Bayes gives the best accuracy of 88.17% whereas random forest gives the best area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.97.;32;1;Innovative Technologies;2024-10-28T20:46:16.455086Z;https://doi.org/10.3390/iot1020014;https://openalex.org/W3092005458;Lexical analysis, Emotion Recognition, Machine Translation, Sentiment Analysis, Twitter Sentiment, Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis, Stop words;5.477;Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining;Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data of World Cup Soccer Tournament Using Machine Learning;2024-10-28T20:46:16.455099Z
Scouts of soccer clubs are often the first to identify talented players. However, there is a lack of research on how these scouts assess and predict overall soccer performance. Therefore, we conducted a large-scaled study to examine the process of talent identification among 125 soccer scouts. Through an online self-report questionnaire, scouts were asked about (1) the players' age at which they can predict players' soccer performance, (2) the attributes they consider relevant, and (3) the extent to which they predict performance in a structured manner. The most important results are as follows. First, scouts who observed 12-year-old and younger players perceived they could predict at older ages (13.6 years old, on average) whether a player has the potential to become a professional soccer player. This suggests that scouts are aware of the idea that early indicators of later performance are often lacking, yet do advise on selection of players at younger ages. Second, when identifying talented players, scouts considered more easily observable attributes, such as technical attributes. However, scouts described these often in a broad sense rather than in terms of specific predictors of future performance. Finally, scouts reported that they assess attributes of players in a structured manner. Yet, they ultimately based their prediction (i.e. final score) on an intuitive integration of different performance attributes, which is a suboptimal strategy according to existing literature. Taken together, these outcomes provide specific clues to improve the reliability and validity of the scouting process. HighlightsBased on a large sample of soccer scouts, we examine three issues that are important in the process of identifying talented soccer players: The age at which good performance predictions can be made, which attributes are relevant predictors, and how performance predictions are formed.Scouts who observe players in young age cohorts believe that the age at which they can predict performance is older than the players they typically scout, suggesting that they are aware that early indicators of performance are often lacking.Technical performance attributes are considered as most important performance predictors by scouts, but these are often described in a broad - rather than specific - sense.Scouts indicate that they predict performance in a structured manner, but form their overall performance prediction on an intuitive integration of different performance attributes, which can be a suboptimal approach.;33;1;Scouting / Finance;2024-10-28T20:46:19.866096Z;https://doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2021.1916081;https://openalex.org/W3152927413;Boy Scouts, Soccer Performance, Sport Psychology, Coaching Effectiveness, Sample (material), Identification (biology);3.287;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;How soccer scouts identify talented players;2024-10-28T20:46:19.866108Z
To investigate the effects of mental fatigue on soccer-specific physical and technical performance in young players.Twelve under-14 (U14), twelve under-16 (U16) and twelve under-18 (U18) soccer players completed the two parts of the investigation. Part one assessed the soccer-specific physical performance using the Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test, Level 1 (Yo-Yo IR1). Part two assessed the soccer-specific technical performance using the Loughborough Soccer Passing and Shooting Tests (LSPT, LSST). Each part was preceded by 30 min of Stroop task or 15 min of control task performed in a randomised and counterbalanced order.Subjective ratings of mental fatigue were higher after the Stroop task compared to the control in U14, U16 and U18 in both parts. Mental fatigue significantly reduced Yo-Yo IR1 distance, alongside an increase in heart rate and ratings of perceived exertion, and this effect was moderated by age as older players showed greater declines in performance. Soccer-specific technical performance was negatively affected by mental fatigue condition only in U18 in the LSPT..;34;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T20:46:23.508352Z;https://doi.org/10.1080/24733938.2020.1823012;https://openalex.org/W3086218720;Stroop effect, Mental fatigue, Soccer Performance, Training Load, Exercise Capacity, Perceived exertion;3.535;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;Effects of mental fatigue on soccer-specific performance in young players;2024-10-28T20:46:23.508370Z
"Abstract The aims of this study were to establish sources of variability in match physical performance of professional soccer players and provide a method for monitoring individual between‐match changes. Eleven players meeting the final inclusion criteria were monitored through an entire in‐season competition phase ( n = 240 individual match observations). Ten Hertz global positioning systems were used to measure match total distance (TD), total high‐speed running distance (≥ 21 km·h −1 ; HSRD), total accelerations (TAcc) and maximum running velocity ( V max ). Between‐player, between‐position, between‐match and within‐player variability were determined through linear mixed effects models. These data were then used to establish the practical significance of individual changes using a Minimum Effects Testing framework. All sources of variability were greater for HSRD (13–36%) when compared with all other metrics (&lt;6%). Using combined between‐match and within‐player variability along with the smallest worthwhile change (0.2 × between‐player SD), between‐match individual changes of ±∼10–15% in TD, TAcc and V max were established as practically significant. For HSRD, these thresholds were considerably higher (≥60%). In conclusion, the ability for soccer practitioners to identify meaningful changes in match physical performance can aid decision making around player management following competition. Our study provides a method to flag changes beyond the normal match‐to‐match variability and by a substantial magnitude. This may have implications for recovery but should be combined with other sources of data (internal load and response) and used only as an adjunct to practitioner domain knowledge/experience.";35;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T20:47:44.686953Z;https://doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2020.1842513;https://openalex.org/W3093559451;Athlete Monitoring, Soccer Performance, Sport Psychology, Coaching Effectiveness, Performance Analysis, Match play;81.02;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;Decomposing the variability of match physical performance in professional soccer: Implications for monitoring individuals;2024-10-28T20:47:44.686974Z
The purpose of the current study was to compare the results of a progressive strength training protocol for soccer players after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with healthy controls, and to investigate the effects of the strength training protocol on peak quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength. Between subjects design. Outpatient physical therapy facility. Thirty-eight amateur male soccer players after ACLR were included. Thirty age-matched amateur male soccer players served as control group. Quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength was measured at three time points during the rehabilitation. Limb symmetry index (LSI) > 90% was used as cut-off criteria. Soccer players after ACLR had no significant differences in peak quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength in the injured leg at 7 months after ACLR compared to the dominant leg of the control group. Furthermore, 65.8% of soccer players after ACLR passed LSI >90% at 10 months for quadriceps muscle strength. Amateur male soccer players after ACLR can achieve similar quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength at 7 months compared to healthy controls. These findings highlight the potential of progressive strength training in rehabilitation after ACLR that may mitigate commonly reported strength deficits.;36;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T20:48:00.207749Z;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ptsp.2019.08.004;https://openalex.org/W2968930556;Athletic Rehabilitation, Strength training;15.33;Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries in Athletes;Progressive strength training restores quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength within 7 months after ACL reconstruction in amateur male soccer players;2024-10-28T20:48:00.207767Z
"The aim of this study was to determine what physical and technical activities of soccer players in different pitch positions affect significantly the match outcome of professional German soccer players; as well as to examine whether differences in physical and technical activities increase or reduce the probability of a match being won.The study sample comprised 4393 individual match observations of 350 soccer players competing in the Bundesliga during the 2014/2015 domestic season. Analysis was confined to outfield players (other than goalkeepers) who completed entire matches, and was carried out using the Impire AG motion analysis system. The selection of physical and technical activities to be used in predictive models was achieved using the lasso method.The odds ratio revealed that an mean running speed in the second half that was greater by 0.1 km/h was associated with a 27.0% improvement in the odds of a match being won (OR=1.27; 95% CI: 1.17 to 1.38) (forwards), 15.7% (OR=1.16; 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.23) (wide midfielders), and 10.0% (OR=1.10; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.17) (central midfielders). Furthermore, in the case of wide midfielders, a significant variable was the distance covered at >24 km/h, with an increase of 0.1 km associated with odds of winning the game improved by 31.7% (OR=1.32; 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.66).Match outcome is affected significantly where peak and mean running speeds in the second half of the match are greater, and where longer distances are covered at speeds in excess of 24 km/h.";37;1;Tactics analysis;2024-10-28T20:48:18.713277Z;https://doi.org/10.23736/s0022-4707.18.08506-7;https://openalex.org/W2930515652;Odds, Soccer Performance, Athlete Monitoring, Performance Analysis, Match play, Training Load;18.349;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;Modeling of relationships between physical and technical activities and match outcome in elite German soccer players;2024-10-28T20:48:18.713294Z

"Abstract The aim of the present meta-analysis was to compare the maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) characteristics of male soccer players relative to their competitive level, playing position and age group and the interaction between them. The meta-analysis was based on 16 studies, employing 2385 soccer players aged 10–39 years. Higher-level soccer players showed greater (ES = 0.58 [95% CI 0.08-1.08], SE = 0.25, var = 0.06, z = 2.29, p = 0.022) VO2max performance with respect to their lower level counterparts. Furthermore, lower VO2max values in goalkeepers than defenders (ES = 1.31 (SE 0.46) [95% CI 0.41-2.21], var = 0.21, z = 2.84, p = 0.004) and midfielders (ES = 1.37 (SE 0.41) [95% CI 0.58 to 2.17], var = 0.16, z = 3.40, p = 0.001) were found. Thus, VO2max increased significantly with age (all, p &lt; 0.01): Under 10 versus Under 11 years, Under 11 versus Under 12 years, Under 12 versus Under 13 years, Under 13 versus Under 14 years, Under 14 versus Under 15 years and Under 16-18 versus Under 20-23 years. VO2max performance is the most powerful discriminator between higher and lower-level soccer players. These findings indicate also the need for sports scientists and conditioning professionals to take the VO2max performance of soccer players into account when designing individualized position specific training programs.";39;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T20:48:50.807392Z;https://doi.org/10.2478/hukin-2018-0060;https://openalex.org/W2930891275;Oxygen Uptake, Soccer Performance, Exercise Capacity, Athlete Monitoring;7.482;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;Maximum Oxygen Uptake of Male Soccer Players According to their Competitive Level, Playing Position and Age Group: Implication from a Network Meta-Analysis;2024-10-28T20:48:50.807406Z
"Abstract Olthof, SBH, Frencken, WGP, and Lemmink, KAPM. A match-derived relative pitch area facilitates the tactical representativeness of small-sided games for the official soccer match. J Strength Cond Res 33(2): 523–530, 2019—Small-sided games (SSGs) are a promising training format in soccer to replicate (situations of) the official match across all age groups. Typically, SSGs are played on a smaller relative pitch area (RPA; i.e., &lt;150 m 2 ) than the match (320 m 2 RPA), which results in different tactical demands. To create a more precise replication of tactical match demands in SSGs with less than 11 players per team, a match-derived RPA (320 m 2 ) may be considered because this affords a similar playing area per player. In addition, subgroup analysis is necessary to deal with the different number of players in match and SSGs. Therefore, this study aims to investigate tactical demands of matches and various SSGs—with a different number of players and played on 320 m 2 RPA—in talented youth soccer players. Twelve elite soccer teams in 4 age categories (under-13, under-15, under-17, and under-19) played official matches and 4 vs. 4 + goalkeepers (GKs), 6 vs. 6 + GKs, and 8 vs. 8 + GKs. Positional data were collected to calculate tactical variables (interpersonal distances, length, width, and surface areas) for all players and for 2- and 4-player subgroups. Corresponding tactical variability (coefficients of variation expressed as percentages) was determined for all players. Results demonstrated that in each age category, with an increase in number of players, team distances increased and tactical variability decreased. Subgroup analyses revealed similar team distances in matches and SSGs with the exception of larger interpersonal distances in 4 vs. 4 + GKs than the match in under-13, under-15, and under-17. Match-derived RPA in SSGs facilitates the tactical representativeness for the match. Soccer coaches can use such SSGs for an optimal tactical match preparation.";40;1;Tactics analysis;2024-10-28T20:49:05.729697Z;https://doi.org/10.1519/jsc.0000000000002978;https://openalex.org/W2905492083;Relative pitch, Soccer Performance, Elite, Replicate;14.794;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;A Match-Derived Relative Pitch Area Facilitates the Tactical Representativeness of Small-Sided Games for the Official Soccer Match;2024-10-28T20:49:05.729739Z
Abstract This study assessed the internal and external workload of starters and non-starters in a professional top-level soccer team during a congested fixture period. Twenty Serie A soccer players were monitored in this study during two mesocycles of 21 days each. Starters and non-starters were divided based on the match time played in each mesocycle. The following metrics were recorded: exposure time, total distance, relative total distance, high-speed running distance over 20 km·h−1, very high-speed running distance over 25 km·h−1, individual very high-speed distance over 80% of maximum peak speed, and rating of perceived exertion. Differences between starters and non-starters were found for: exposure time (effect size=large to very large), rating of perceived exertion (large to very large), total distance (large to very large), and individual very high-speed distance over 80% of maximum peak speed (moderate to large). Furthermore, differences for relative total distance, high-speed running distance over 20 km·h−1 and very high-speed running distance over 25 km·h−1 were small to moderate, but not significant. This study reports that during congested fixture periods, starters had higher exposure time, rating of perceived exertion, total distance, and individual very high-speed distance over 80% of maximum peak speed than non-starters.;41;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T20:50:38.986176Z;https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1171-1865;https://openalex.org/W3030999601;Fixture, Training Load, Soccer Performance, Perceived exertion, Athlete Monitoring, Match play;93.047;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;Workload Monitoring in Top-level Soccer Players During Congested Fixture Periods;2024-10-28T20:50:38.986187Z
In recent years, sports entrepreneurship has emerged as a promising discipline in the field of sports management research. However, the research field is still fragmented. This study gives an overview of sports entrepreneurship and coopetition research and is the first work analyzing EO and performance in professional sports. First, quantitative results about EO, organizational performance and coopetition of 22 professional soccer clubs were obtained. Following the mixed method approach, the data was then extended by qualitative expert interviews. Entrepreneurial orientation had a significant positive relationship with both financial and sporting performance of professional soccer clubs in German-speaking countries during the 2017/18 season. We suggest coopetition as a promising strategy for professional soccer clubs to succeed. Hence, our study fosters the concept of sports entrepreneurship and offers evidence that entrepreneurial orientation is a well-suited managerial approach to enhance organizational performance in professional soccer.;42;1;Scouting / Finance;2024-10-28T20:50:47.492895Z;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11365-019-00594-5;https://openalex.org/W2954895324;Coopetition, Entrepreneurial orientation, Professional sport, Sport management, Sport Tourism, Sports marketing;8.385;Coopetition in Business Networks and Innovation;Entrepreneurial orientation in sports entrepreneurship - a mixed methods analysis of professional soccer clubs in the German-speaking countries;2024-10-28T20:50:47.492908Z

"Objective: To examine training and match loads undertaken by soccer players competing in the English Premier League.Methods: Using a retrospective design, external (GPS) and internal training loads (sessions ratings of perceived exertion [sRPE-TL]) were examined in 26 players across the competition phase of the 2012–2013 English Premier League season. Within-subject linear mixed-models estimated the mean effects (95% confidence interval [CI]) for load data across 6-week mesocycles and 1-week microcycles.Results: Daily sRPE-TL (95% CI range, 15 to 111 AU) and total distance (95% CI range, 179 to 949 AU) were higher during the early stages (mesocycle 1 and 2) of the competition period. Overall, high-speed activity was similar between mesocycles. Across the training week, load was greater on match day and lower pre match-day (G-1) vs. all other days, respectively (p < 0.001). sRPE-TL (~70–90 AU per day) and total distance (~700–800 m per day) progressively declined over the 3 days before a match (p < 0.001). High-speed distance was greater 3 days (G-3) before a game vs. G-1 (95% CI, 140 to 336 m) while very high-speed distance was greater on G-3 and G-2 than G-1 (95% CI range, 8 to 62 m; p < 0.001).Conclusion: Periodisation of in-season training load is mainly evident across the weekly microcycle reflecting the recovery and preparation for matches.";44;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T20:51:14.767294Z;https://doi.org/10.1080/24733938.2019.1651934;https://openalex.org/W2966388390;Elite, Training Load, Athlete Monitoring, Soccer Performance, Performance Analysis, Athletic Training, Match play;23.129;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;Quantification of training and match-load distribution across a season in elite English Premier League soccer players;2024-10-28T20:51:14.767302Z
Overuse injury risk increases during periods of accelerated growth, which can subsequently impact development in academy soccer, suggesting a need to quantify training exposure. Nonprescriptive development scheme legislation could lead to inconsistent approaches to monitoring maturity and training load. Therefore, this study aimed to communicate current practices of UK soccer academies toward biological maturity and training load.Forty-nine respondents completed an online survey representing support staff from male Premier League academies (n = 38) and female Regional Talent Clubs (n = 11). The survey included 16 questions covering maturity and training-load monitoring. Questions were multiple-choice or unipolar scaled (agreement 0-100) with a magnitude-based decision approach used for interpretation.Injury prevention was deemed highest importance for maturity (83.0 [5.3], mean [SD]) and training-load monitoring (80.0 [2.8]). There were large differences in methods adopted for maturity estimation and moderate differences for training-load monitoring between academies. Predictions of maturity were deemed comparatively low in importance for bio-banded (biological classification) training (61.0 [3.3]) and low for bio-banded competition (56.0 [1.8]) across academies. Few respondents reported maturity (42%) and training load (16%) to parent/guardians, and only 9% of medical staff were routinely provided this data.Although consistencies between academies exist, disparities in monitoring approaches are likely reflective of environment-specific resource and logistical constraints. Designating consistent and qualified responsibility to staff will help promote fidelity, feedback, and transparency to advise stakeholders of maturity-load relationships. Practitioners should consider biological categorization to manage load prescription to promote maturity-appropriate dose-responses and to help reduce the risk of noncontact injury.;45;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T20:51:19.667014Z;https://doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2019-0624;https://openalex.org/W3025963580;Training Load, Athlete Monitoring, Soccer Performance;4.78;Epidemiology of Sports-Related Musculoskeletal Injuries;Monitoring Practices of Training Load and Biological Maturity in UK Soccer Academies;2024-10-28T20:51:19.667032Z
Playing with a soccer ball is not easy even for a real human because of dynamic foot contacts with the moving ball while chasing and controlling it. The problem of online full-body soccer motion synthesis is challenging and has not been fully solved yet. In this paper, we present a novel motion control system that produces physically-correct full-body soccer motions: dribbling forward, dribbling to the side, and shooting, in response to an online user motion prescription specified by a motion type, a running speed, and a turning angle. This system performs two tightly-coupled tasks: data-driven motion prediction and physics-based motion synthesis. Given example motion data, the former synthesizes a reference motion in accordance with an online user input and further refines the motion to make the character kick the ball at a right time and place. Provided with the reference motion, the latter then adopts a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to generate a physically-correct soccer motion, by solving an optimal control problem that is formulated based on dynamics for a full-body character and the moving ball together with their interactions. Our demonstration shows the effectiveness of the proposed system that synthesizes convincing full-body soccer motions in various scenarios such as adjusting the desired running speed of the character, changing the velocity and the mass of the ball, and maintaining balance against external forces.;46;1;Innovative Technologies;2024-10-28T20:51:36.684825Z;https://doi.org/10.1145/3306346.3322963;https://openalex.org/W2957323419;Ball (mathematics), Human Motion Data, Motion Synthesis, Motion Capture, Soccer Video, Physics-based Animation;16.893;Motion Synthesis and Control Techniques;Physics-based full-body soccer motion control for dribbling and shooting;2024-10-28T20:51:36.684880Z
While many research efforts have focused on head impact exposure in professional soccer, there have been few studies characterizing exposure at the youth level. The aim of this study is to evaluate a new instrumentation approach and collect some of the first head impact exposure data for youth female soccer players. Athletes were instrumented with custom-fit mouthpieces that measure head impacts. Detailed video analysis was conducted to identify characteristics describing impact source (e.g., kick, header, throw). A total of 763 verified head impacts were collected over 23 practices and 8 games from 7 athletes. The median peak linear accelerations, rotational velocities, and rotational accelerations of all impacts were 9.4 g, 4.1 rad/s, and 689 rad/s2, respectively. Pairwise comparisons resulted in statistically significant differences in kinematics by impact source. Headers following a kicked ball had the highest accelerations and velocity when compared to headers from thrown or another header.;47;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T20:51:43.217556Z;https://doi.org/10.1080/15438627.2019.1590833;https://openalex.org/W2921365809;Sports-related, Mouthpiece, Header, Linear acceleration;6.414;Epidemiology and Impact of Traumatic Brain Injury;Characterizing head impact exposure in youth female soccer with a custom-instrumented mouthpiece;2024-10-28T20:51:43.217583Z
"Abstract The aims of this study were to: (1) identify the representative external load profile of match‐play in Spanish professional soccer players by principal components analysis (PCA), and (2) analyse the effect of match location (home vs away), match outcome (win vs draw vs loss) and length of the microcycle (5 vs 6 vs 7 vs 8 vs 9 days) on the external load profile. Data were collected during one season consisting of 42 matches in LaLiga 123 and 11 external load variables were selected after the PCA. TD, total distance covered; DIS 0–6 : distance from 0 to 6 km/h; DIS 21–24 : distance from 21 to 24 km/h; HSRD: high‐speed running distance above 21 km/h; HSRA: total of high‐speed running actions above 21 km/h; V MAX : maximum speed in km/h; Sprints: total of actions above 24 km/h; ACC: total of accelerations; ACC G‐avg : average accelerometer G‐force; ACC MAX : maximum acceleration (m/s2); DEC MAX : maximum deceleration (m/s 2 ). Match location had an impact on HSRD ( p &lt; 0.01; ES = 0.05), DIS 0–6 ( p &lt; 0.01; ES = 0.05), and ACC MAX ( p &lt; 0.01; ES = 0.05). Match outcome had a relation to TD ( p &lt; 0.01; ES = 0.05), DIS 0–6 ( p &lt; 0.01; ES = 0.05) and HSRD ( p &lt; 0.01; ES = 0.05). Length of the microcycle had an impact on TD ( p &lt; 0.01; ES = 0.05), DIS 0–6 ( p &lt; 0.01; ES = 0.11), ACC ( p &lt; 0.01; ES = 0.04) and V MAX ( p &lt; 0.01; ES = 0.04). This study provides coaches a selection of variables for match‐play analysis, which could represent two‐thirds of external load profile. Then, professionals should consider that these contextual variables could have an impact on the external load profile.";48;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T20:52:17.292495Z;https://doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2020.1751305;https://openalex.org/W3014481292;Match play, Training Load, Sport Psychology, Performance Analysis, Coaching Effectiveness;33.929;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;Impact of contextual variables on the representative external load profile of Spanish professional soccer match-play: A full season study;2024-10-28T20:52:17.292529Z
Purpose : To investigate the relationship between sleep quality and quantity and injuries in elite soccer players and to compare sleep–wake variables and injury characteristics. Methods : The current investigation was a prospective cohort study of 23 elite male soccer players competing for 2 teams over 6 mo in the highest-level Brazilian competition. The players’ sleep behavior was monitored for 10 d in the preseason using self-reporting sleep diaries and wrist activity monitors to determine sleep duration and quality. Furthermore, injuries were recorded by the respective club’s medical teams into a specific database. Details of injuries recorded included the type, location, and severity of each injury. The results were expressed as descriptive statistics, and the significance level was set at 5%. The Mann–Whitney U test was performed to compare the sleep variables between groups. Spearman correlation coefficient and linear-regression analysis were used. Results : The results indicated a moderate negative correlation between sleep efficiency and particular injury characteristics, including absence time, injury severity, and amount of injuries. The linear-regression analysis indicated that 44% of the total variance in the number of injuries can be explained by sleep efficiency, 24% of the total variance in the absence time after injury (days) can be explained by sleep efficiency, and 47% of the total variance in the injury severity can be explained by sleep efficiency. Conclusions : Soccer players who exhibit lower sleep quality or nonrestorative sleep show associations with increased number and severity of musculoskeletal injuries.;49;1;Medical / Injuries;2024-10-28T20:52:23.016626Z;https://doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2019-0185;https://openalex.org/W2988510406;Sleep Quality, Sleep (system call), Sleep Duration, Athlete Monitoring, Soccer Performance, Explained variation, Stepwise regression;5.596;Sleep and Insomnia;Poor Sleep Quality’s Association With Soccer Injuries: Preliminary Data;2024-10-28T20:52:23.016639Z
In 2020 the world faces an unprecedented challenge consequence of the coronavirus pandemic. Soccer, arguably, one of the most globalized industries, has reacted to the event by closing down much of its operations. This paper reviews the speed and breadth of such closures and compares it to another major event in history: The Second World War. During the latter, soccer continued operations despite the apparent difficulties. Total closures were, for the most part, temporary, and the sport was practiced whenever possible. The way that soccer operated during the war contrasts with how it has responded to the COVID-19 crisis. In record time, virtually all leagues in the world stopped operations, and for the first time since its foundation, with but a few exceptions, there were no games anywhere in the world.;50;1;Other;2024-10-28T20:52:28.782426Z;https://doi.org/10.1080/14660970.2020.1755270;https://openalex.org/W3016028081;Shut down, Pandemic, First world war, Social Distancing, Coronavirus, 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak;5.659;Evolution and Impacts of Event Tourism;Soccer, World War II and coronavirus: a comparative analysis of how the sport shut down;2024-10-28T20:52:28.782450Z
