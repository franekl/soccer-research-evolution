"In the derived approach, an analysis is performed on Twitter data for World Cup soccer 2014 held in Brazil to detect the sentiment of the people throughout the world using machine learning techniques. By filtering and analyzing the data using natural language processing techniques, sentiment polarity was calculated based on the emotion words detected in the user tweets. The dataset is normalized to be used by machine learning algorithms and prepared using natural language processing techniques like word tokenization, stemming and lemmatization, part-of-speech (POS) tagger, name entity recognition (NER), and parser to extract emotions for the textual data from each tweet. This approach is implemented using Python programming language and Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). A derived algorithm extracts emotional words using WordNet with its POS (part-of-speech) for the word in a sentence that has a meaning in the current context, and is assigned sentiment polarity using the SentiWordNet dictionary or using a lexicon-based method. The resultant polarity assigned is further analyzed using naïve Bayes, support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and random forest machine learning algorithms and visualized on the Weka platform. Naïve Bayes gives the best accuracy of 88.17% whereas random forest gives the best area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.97.",52,"1","Innovative Technologies","2024-11-24T17:42:56.448884Z","https://doi.org/10.3390/iot1020014","https://openalex.org/W3092005458","Lexical analysis, Emotion Recognition, Machine Translation, Sentiment Analysis, Twitter Sentiment, Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis, Stop words",43.053,"Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining","Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data of World Cup Soccer Tournament Using Machine Learning","2024-11-24T17:42:56.448921Z"
"Scouts of soccer clubs are often the first to identify talented players. However, there is a lack of research on how these scouts assess and predict overall soccer performance. Therefore, we conducted a large-scaled study to examine the process of talent identification among 125 soccer scouts. Through an online self-report questionnaire, scouts were asked about (1) the players' age at which they can predict players' soccer performance, (2) the attributes they consider relevant, and (3) the extent to which they predict performance in a structured manner. The most important results are as follows. First, scouts who observed 12-year-old and younger players perceived they could predict at older ages (13.6 years old, on average) whether a player has the potential to become a professional soccer player. This suggests that scouts are aware of the idea that early indicators of later performance are often lacking, yet do advise on selection of players at younger ages. Second, when identifying talented players, scouts considered more easily observable attributes, such as technical attributes. However, scouts described these often in a broad sense rather than in terms of specific predictors of future performance. Finally, scouts reported that they assess attributes of players in a structured manner. Yet, they ultimately based their prediction (i.e. final score) on an intuitive integration of different performance attributes, which is a suboptimal strategy according to existing literature. Taken together, these outcomes provide specific clues to improve the reliability and validity of the scouting process. HighlightsBased on a large sample of soccer scouts, we examine three issues that are important in the process of identifying talented soccer players: The age at which good performance predictions can be made, which attributes are relevant predictors, and how performance predictions are formed.Scouts who observe players in young age cohorts believe that the age at which they can predict performance is older than the players they typically scout, suggesting that they are aware that early indicators of performance are often lacking.Technical performance attributes are considered as most important performance predictors by scouts, but these are often described in a broad - rather than specific - sense.Scouts indicate that they predict performance in a structured manner, but form their overall performance prediction on an intuitive integration of different performance attributes, which can be a suboptimal approach.",53,"1","Scouting / Finance","2024-11-24T17:43:29.916427Z","https://doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2021.1916081","https://openalex.org/W3152927413","Boy Scouts, Soccer Performance, Sport Psychology, Coaching Effectiveness, Sample (material), Identification (biology)",25.376,"Sports Science and Performance Analysis","How soccer scouts identify talented players","2024-11-24T17:43:29.916492Z"
"To investigate the effects of mental fatigue on soccer-specific physical and technical performance in young players.Twelve under-14 (U14), twelve under-16 (U16) and twelve under-18 (U18) soccer players completed the two parts of the investigation. Part one assessed the soccer-specific physical performance using the Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test, Level 1 (Yo-Yo IR1). Part two assessed the soccer-specific technical performance using the Loughborough Soccer Passing and Shooting Tests (LSPT, LSST). Each part was preceded by 30 min of Stroop task or 15 min of control task performed in a randomised and counterbalanced order.Subjective ratings of mental fatigue were higher after the Stroop task compared to the control in U14, U16 and U18 in both parts. Mental fatigue significantly reduced Yo-Yo IR1 distance, alongside an increase in heart rate and ratings of perceived exertion, and this effect was moderated by age as older players showed greater declines in performance. Soccer-specific technical performance was negatively affected by mental fatigue condition only in U18 in the LSPT..",54,"1","Psychology","2024-11-24T17:44:25.330034Z","https://doi.org/10.1080/24733938.2020.1823012","https://openalex.org/W3086218720","Stroop effect, Mental fatigue, Soccer Performance, Training Load, Exercise Capacity, Perceived exertion",45.554,"Sports Science and Performance Analysis","Effects of mental fatigue on soccer-specific performance in young players","2024-11-24T17:44:25.330069Z"
"Abstract The aims of this study were to establish sources of variability in match physical performance of professional soccer players and provide a method for monitoring individual between‐match changes. Eleven players meeting the final inclusion criteria were monitored through an entire in‐season competition phase ( n = 240 individual match observations). Ten Hertz global positioning systems were used to measure match total distance (TD), total high‐speed running distance (≥ 21 km·h −1 ; HSRD), total accelerations (TAcc) and maximum running velocity ( V max ). Between‐player, between‐position, between‐match and within‐player variability were determined through linear mixed effects models. These data were then used to establish the practical significance of individual changes using a Minimum Effects Testing framework. All sources of variability were greater for HSRD (13–36%) when compared with all other metrics (&lt;6%). Using combined between‐match and within‐player variability along with the smallest worthwhile change (0.2 × between‐player SD), between‐match individual changes of ±∼10–15% in TD, TAcc and V max were established as practically significant. For HSRD, these thresholds were considerably higher (≥60%). In conclusion, the ability for soccer practitioners to identify meaningful changes in match physical performance can aid decision making around player management following competition. Our study provides a method to flag changes beyond the normal match‐to‐match variability and by a substantial magnitude. This may have implications for recovery but should be combined with other sources of data (internal load and response) and used only as an adjunct to practitioner domain knowledge/experience.",55,"1","Physical Attributes","2024-11-24T17:45:15.930528Z","https://doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2020.1842513","https://openalex.org/W3093559451","Athlete Monitoring, Soccer Performance, Sport Psychology, Coaching Effectiveness, Performance Analysis, Match play",40.171,"Sports Science and Performance Analysis","Decomposing the variability of match physical performance in professional soccer: Implications for monitoring individuals","2024-11-24T17:45:15.930638Z"
"The purpose of the current study was to compare the results of a progressive strength training protocol for soccer players after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with healthy controls, and to investigate the effects of the strength training protocol on peak quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength. Between subjects design. Outpatient physical therapy facility. Thirty-eight amateur male soccer players after ACLR were included. Thirty age-matched amateur male soccer players served as control group. Quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength was measured at three time points during the rehabilitation. Limb symmetry index (LSI) > 90% was used as cut-off criteria. Soccer players after ACLR had no significant differences in peak quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength in the injured leg at 7 months after ACLR compared to the dominant leg of the control group. Furthermore, 65.8% of soccer players after ACLR passed LSI >90% at 10 months for quadriceps muscle strength. Amateur male soccer players after ACLR can achieve similar quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength at 7 months compared to healthy controls. These findings highlight the potential of progressive strength training in rehabilitation after ACLR that may mitigate commonly reported strength deficits.",56,"1","Medical / Injuries","2024-11-24T17:45:42.860713Z","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ptsp.2019.08.004","https://openalex.org/W2968930556","Athletic Rehabilitation, Strength training",11.808,"Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries in Athletes","Progressive strength training restores quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength within 7 months after ACL reconstruction in amateur male soccer players","2024-11-24T17:45:42.860748Z"
"The aim of this study was to determine what physical and technical activities of soccer players in different pitch positions affect significantly the match outcome of professional German soccer players; as well as to examine whether differences in physical and technical activities increase or reduce the probability of a match being won.The study sample comprised 4393 individual match observations of 350 soccer players competing in the Bundesliga during the 2014/2015 domestic season. Analysis was confined to outfield players (other than goalkeepers) who completed entire matches, and was carried out using the Impire AG motion analysis system. The selection of physical and technical activities to be used in predictive models was achieved using the lasso method.The odds ratio revealed that an mean running speed in the second half that was greater by 0.1 km/h was associated with a 27.0% improvement in the odds of a match being won (OR=1.27; 95% CI: 1.17 to 1.38) (forwards), 15.7% (OR=1.16; 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.23) (wide midfielders), and 10.0% (OR=1.10; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.17) (central midfielders). Furthermore, in the case of wide midfielders, a significant variable was the distance covered at >24 km/h, with an increase of 0.1 km associated with odds of winning the game improved by 31.7% (OR=1.32; 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.66).Match outcome is affected significantly where peak and mean running speeds in the second half of the match are greater, and where longer distances are covered at speeds in excess of 24 km/h.",57,"1","Tactics analysis","2024-11-24T17:47:46.897126Z","https://doi.org/10.23736/s0022-4707.18.08506-7","https://openalex.org/W2930515652","Odds, Soccer Performance, Athlete Monitoring, Performance Analysis, Match play, Training Load",117.553,"Sports Science and Performance Analysis","Modeling of relationships between physical and technical activities and match outcome in elite German soccer players","2024-11-24T17:47:46.897162Z"
"Abstract The aim of the present meta-analysis was to compare the maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) characteristics of male soccer players relative to their competitive level, playing position and age group and the interaction between them. The meta-analysis was based on 16 studies, employing 2385 soccer players aged 10–39 years. Higher-level soccer players showed greater (ES = 0.58 [95% CI 0.08-1.08], SE = 0.25, var = 0.06, z = 2.29, p = 0.022) VO2max performance with respect to their lower level counterparts. Furthermore, lower VO2max values in goalkeepers than defenders (ES = 1.31 (SE 0.46) [95% CI 0.41-2.21], var = 0.21, z = 2.84, p = 0.004) and midfielders (ES = 1.37 (SE 0.41) [95% CI 0.58 to 2.17], var = 0.16, z = 3.40, p = 0.001) were found. Thus, VO2max increased significantly with age (all, p &lt; 0.01): Under 10 versus Under 11 years, Under 11 versus Under 12 years, Under 12 versus Under 13 years, Under 13 versus Under 14 years, Under 14 versus Under 15 years and Under 16-18 versus Under 20-23 years. VO2max performance is the most powerful discriminator between higher and lower-level soccer players. These findings indicate also the need for sports scientists and conditioning professionals to take the VO2max performance of soccer players into account when designing individualized position specific training programs.",58,"1","Physical Attributes","2024-11-24T17:48:37.645707Z","https://doi.org/10.2478/hukin-2018-0060","https://openalex.org/W2930891275","Oxygen Uptake, Soccer Performance, Exercise Capacity, Athlete Monitoring",10.129,"Sports Science and Performance Analysis","Maximum Oxygen Uptake of Male Soccer Players According to their Competitive Level, Playing Position and Age Group: Implication from a Network Meta-Analysis","2024-11-24T17:48:37.645742Z"
"Abstract Olthof, SBH, Frencken, WGP, and Lemmink, KAPM. A match-derived relative pitch area facilitates the tactical representativeness of small-sided games for the official soccer match. J Strength Cond Res 33(2): 523–530, 2019—Small-sided games (SSGs) are a promising training format in soccer to replicate (situations of) the official match across all age groups. Typically, SSGs are played on a smaller relative pitch area (RPA; i.e., &lt;150 m 2 ) than the match (320 m 2 RPA), which results in different tactical demands. To create a more precise replication of tactical match demands in SSGs with less than 11 players per team, a match-derived RPA (320 m 2 ) may be considered because this affords a similar playing area per player. In addition, subgroup analysis is necessary to deal with the different number of players in match and SSGs. Therefore, this study aims to investigate tactical demands of matches and various SSGs—with a different number of players and played on 320 m 2 RPA—in talented youth soccer players. Twelve elite soccer teams in 4 age categories (under-13, under-15, under-17, and under-19) played official matches and 4 vs. 4 + goalkeepers (GKs), 6 vs. 6 + GKs, and 8 vs. 8 + GKs. Positional data were collected to calculate tactical variables (interpersonal distances, length, width, and surface areas) for all players and for 2- and 4-player subgroups. Corresponding tactical variability (coefficients of variation expressed as percentages) was determined for all players. Results demonstrated that in each age category, with an increase in number of players, team distances increased and tactical variability decreased. Subgroup analyses revealed similar team distances in matches and SSGs with the exception of larger interpersonal distances in 4 vs. 4 + GKs than the match in under-13, under-15, and under-17. Match-derived RPA in SSGs facilitates the tactical representativeness for the match. Soccer coaches can use such SSGs for an optimal tactical match preparation.",59,"1","Tactics analysis","2024-11-24T17:49:28.586142Z","https://doi.org/10.1519/jsc.0000000000002978","https://openalex.org/W2905492083","Relative pitch, Soccer Performance, Elite, Replicate",41.729,"Sports Science and Performance Analysis","A Match-Derived Relative Pitch Area Facilitates the Tactical Representativeness of Small-Sided Games for the Official Soccer Match","2024-11-24T17:49:28.586277Z"
"Abstract This study assessed the internal and external workload of starters and non-starters in a professional top-level soccer team during a congested fixture period. Twenty Serie A soccer players were monitored in this study during two mesocycles of 21 days each. Starters and non-starters were divided based on the match time played in each mesocycle. The following metrics were recorded: exposure time, total distance, relative total distance, high-speed running distance over 20 km·h−1, very high-speed running distance over 25 km·h−1, individual very high-speed distance over 80% of maximum peak speed, and rating of perceived exertion. Differences between starters and non-starters were found for: exposure time (effect size=large to very large), rating of perceived exertion (large to very large), total distance (large to very large), and individual very high-speed distance over 80% of maximum peak speed (moderate to large). Furthermore, differences for relative total distance, high-speed running distance over 20 km·h−1 and very high-speed running distance over 25 km·h−1 were small to moderate, but not significant. This study reports that during congested fixture periods, starters had higher exposure time, rating of perceived exertion, total distance, and individual very high-speed distance over 80% of maximum peak speed than non-starters.",60,"1","Physical Attributes","2024-11-24T17:50:06.059553Z","https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1171-1865","https://openalex.org/W3030999601","Fixture, Training Load, Soccer Performance, Perceived exertion, Athlete Monitoring, Match play",29.25,"Sports Science and Performance Analysis","Workload Monitoring in Top-level Soccer Players During Congested Fixture Periods","2024-11-24T17:50:06.059588Z"
"In recent years, sports entrepreneurship has emerged as a promising discipline in the field of sports management research. However, the research field is still fragmented. This study gives an overview of sports entrepreneurship and coopetition research and is the first work analyzing EO and performance in professional sports. First, quantitative results about EO, organizational performance and coopetition of 22 professional soccer clubs were obtained. Following the mixed method approach, the data was then extended by qualitative expert interviews. Entrepreneurial orientation had a significant positive relationship with both financial and sporting performance of professional soccer clubs in German-speaking countries during the 2017/18 season. We suggest coopetition as a promising strategy for professional soccer clubs to succeed. Hence, our study fosters the concept of sports entrepreneurship and offers evidence that entrepreneurial orientation is a well-suited managerial approach to enhance organizational performance in professional soccer.",61,"1","Scouting / Finance","2024-11-24T17:50:44.347955Z","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11365-019-00594-5","https://openalex.org/W2954895324","Coopetition, Entrepreneurial orientation, Professional sport, Sport management, Sport Tourism, Sports marketing",26.746,"Coopetition in Business Networks and Innovation","Entrepreneurial orientation in sports entrepreneurship - a mixed methods analysis of professional soccer clubs in the German-speaking countries","2024-11-24T17:50:44.348014Z"

"Objective: To examine training and match loads undertaken by soccer players competing in the English Premier League.Methods: Using a retrospective design, external (GPS) and internal training loads (sessions ratings of perceived exertion [sRPE-TL]) were examined in 26 players across the competition phase of the 2012–2013 English Premier League season. Within-subject linear mixed-models estimated the mean effects (95% confidence interval [CI]) for load data across 6-week mesocycles and 1-week microcycles.Results: Daily sRPE-TL (95% CI range, 15 to 111 AU) and total distance (95% CI range, 179 to 949 AU) were higher during the early stages (mesocycle 1 and 2) of the competition period. Overall, high-speed activity was similar between mesocycles. Across the training week, load was greater on match day and lower pre match-day (G-1) vs. all other days, respectively (p < 0.001). sRPE-TL (~70–90 AU per day) and total distance (~700–800 m per day) progressively declined over the 3 days before a match (p < 0.001). High-speed distance was greater 3 days (G-3) before a game vs. G-1 (95% CI, 140 to 336 m) while very high-speed distance was greater on G-3 and G-2 than G-1 (95% CI range, 8 to 62 m; p < 0.001).Conclusion: Periodisation of in-season training load is mainly evident across the weekly microcycle reflecting the recovery and preparation for matches.",63,"1","Physical Attributes","2024-11-24T17:55:54.136237Z","https://doi.org/10.1080/24733938.2019.1651934","https://openalex.org/W2966388390","Elite, Training Load, Athlete Monitoring, Soccer Performance, Performance Analysis, Athletic Training, Match play",269.961,"Sports Science and Performance Analysis","Quantification of training and match-load distribution across a season in elite English Premier League soccer players","2024-11-24T17:55:54.136274Z"
"Overuse injury risk increases during periods of accelerated growth, which can subsequently impact development in academy soccer, suggesting a need to quantify training exposure. Nonprescriptive development scheme legislation could lead to inconsistent approaches to monitoring maturity and training load. Therefore, this study aimed to communicate current practices of UK soccer academies toward biological maturity and training load.Forty-nine respondents completed an online survey representing support staff from male Premier League academies (n = 38) and female Regional Talent Clubs (n = 11). The survey included 16 questions covering maturity and training-load monitoring. Questions were multiple-choice or unipolar scaled (agreement 0-100) with a magnitude-based decision approach used for interpretation.Injury prevention was deemed highest importance for maturity (83.0 [5.3], mean [SD]) and training-load monitoring (80.0 [2.8]). There were large differences in methods adopted for maturity estimation and moderate differences for training-load monitoring between academies. Predictions of maturity were deemed comparatively low in importance for bio-banded (biological classification) training (61.0 [3.3]) and low for bio-banded competition (56.0 [1.8]) across academies. Few respondents reported maturity (42%) and training load (16%) to parent/guardians, and only 9% of medical staff were routinely provided this data.Although consistencies between academies exist, disparities in monitoring approaches are likely reflective of environment-specific resource and logistical constraints. Designating consistent and qualified responsibility to staff will help promote fidelity, feedback, and transparency to advise stakeholders of maturity-load relationships. Practitioners should consider biological categorization to manage load prescription to promote maturity-appropriate dose-responses and to help reduce the risk of noncontact injury.",64,"1","Medical / Injuries","2024-11-24T17:56:34.835028Z","https://doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2019-0624","https://openalex.org/W3025963580","Training Load, Athlete Monitoring, Soccer Performance",27.26,"Epidemiology of Sports-Related Musculoskeletal Injuries","Monitoring Practices of Training Load and Biological Maturity in UK Soccer Academies","2024-11-24T17:56:34.835063Z"
"Playing with a soccer ball is not easy even for a real human because of dynamic foot contacts with the moving ball while chasing and controlling it. The problem of online full-body soccer motion synthesis is challenging and has not been fully solved yet. In this paper, we present a novel motion control system that produces physically-correct full-body soccer motions: dribbling forward, dribbling to the side, and shooting, in response to an online user motion prescription specified by a motion type, a running speed, and a turning angle. This system performs two tightly-coupled tasks: data-driven motion prediction and physics-based motion synthesis. Given example motion data, the former synthesizes a reference motion in accordance with an online user input and further refines the motion to make the character kick the ball at a right time and place. Provided with the reference motion, the latter then adopts a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to generate a physically-correct soccer motion, by solving an optimal control problem that is formulated based on dynamics for a full-body character and the moving ball together with their interactions. Our demonstration shows the effectiveness of the proposed system that synthesizes convincing full-body soccer motions in various scenarios such as adjusting the desired running speed of the character, changing the velocity and the mass of the ball, and maintaining balance against external forces.",65,"1","Innovative Technologies","2024-11-24T17:57:07.548188Z","https://doi.org/10.1145/3306346.3322963","https://openalex.org/W2957323419","Ball (mathematics), Human Motion Data, Motion Synthesis, Motion Capture, Soccer Video, Physics-based Animation",21.489,"Motion Synthesis and Control Techniques","Physics-based full-body soccer motion control for dribbling and shooting","2024-11-24T17:57:07.548230Z"
"While many research efforts have focused on head impact exposure in professional soccer, there have been few studies characterizing exposure at the youth level. The aim of this study is to evaluate a new instrumentation approach and collect some of the first head impact exposure data for youth female soccer players. Athletes were instrumented with custom-fit mouthpieces that measure head impacts. Detailed video analysis was conducted to identify characteristics describing impact source (e.g., kick, header, throw). A total of 763 verified head impacts were collected over 23 practices and 8 games from 7 athletes. The median peak linear accelerations, rotational velocities, and rotational accelerations of all impacts were 9.4 g, 4.1 rad/s, and 689 rad/s2, respectively. Pairwise comparisons resulted in statistically significant differences in kinematics by impact source.

"Purpose : To investigate the relationship between sleep quality and quantity and injuries in elite soccer players and to compare sleep–wake variables and injury characteristics. Methods : The current investigation was a prospective cohort study of 23 elite male soccer players competing for 2 teams over 6 mo in the highest-level Brazilian competition. The players’ sleep behavior was monitored for 10 d in the preseason using self-reporting sleep diaries and wrist activity monitors to determine sleep duration and quality. Furthermore, injuries were recorded by the respective club’s medical teams into a specific database. Details of injuries recorded included the type, location, and severity of each injury. The results were expressed as descriptive statistics, and the significance level was set at 5%. The Mann–Whitney U test was performed to compare the sleep variables between groups. Spearman correlation coefficient and linear-regression analysis were used. Results : The results indicated a moderate negative correlation between sleep efficiency and particular injury characteristics, including absence time, injury severity, and amount of injuries. The linear-regression analysis indicated that 44% of the total variance in the number of injuries can be explained by sleep efficiency, 24% of the total variance in the absence time after injury (days) can be explained by sleep efficiency, and 47% of the total variance in the injury severity can be explained by sleep efficiency.

"In 2020 the world faces an unprecedented challenge consequence of the coronavirus pandemic. Soccer, arguably, one of the most globalized industries, has reacted to the event by closing down much of its operations. This paper reviews the speed and breadth of such closures and compares it to another major event in history: The Second World War.

"Assessments of executive functions (EFs) with varying levels of perceptual information or action fidelity are common talent-diagnostic tools in soccer, yet their validity still has to be established. Therefore, a longitudinal development of EFs in high-level players to understand their relationship with increased exposure to training is required.A total of 304 high-performing male youth soccer players (10-21 years old) in Germany were assessed across three seasons on various sport-specific and non-sport-specific cognitive functioning assessments.The posterior means (90% highest posterior density) of random slopes indicated that both abilities predominantly developed between 10 and 15 years of age. A plateau was apparent for domain-specific abilities during adolescence, whereas domain-generic abilities improved into young adulthood.The developmental trajectories of soccer players' EFs follow the general populations' despite long-term exposure to soccer-specific training and game play. This brings into question the relationship between high-level experience and EFs and renders including EFs in talent identification questionable.",70,"1","Physical Attributes","2024-11-29T19:30:34.018951Z","https://doi.org/10.1123/jsep.2019-0312","https://openalex.org/W3045153501","Talent development, Coaching Effectiveness, Athlete Development, Soccer Performance, Sport Psychology, Youth Sport Specialization, Longitudinal study",35.928,"Development of Expert Performance in Sports Psychology","A Longitudinal Analysis of the Executive Functions in High-Level Soccer Players","2024-11-29T19:30:34.018995Z"
"Abstract In this work, we propose a new hybrid modeling approach for the scores of international soccer matches which combines random forests with Poisson ranking methods . While the random forest is based on the competing teams’ covariate information, the latter method estimates ability parameters on historical match data that adequately reflect the current strength of the teams. We compare the new hybrid random forest model to its separate building blocks as well as to conventional Poisson regression models with regard to their predictive performance on all matches from the four FIFA World Cups 2002–2014. It turns out that by combining the random forest with the team ability parameters from the ranking methods as an additional covariate the predictive power can be improved substantially. Finally, the hybrid random forest is used (in advance of the tournament) to predict the FIFA World Cup 2018. To complete our analysis on the previous World Cup data, the corresponding 64 matches serve as an independent validation data set and we are able to confirm the compelling predictive potential of the hybrid random forest which clearly outperforms all other methods including the betting odds.",71,"1","Innovative Technologies","2024-11-29T19:49:58.538358Z","https://doi.org/10.1515/jqas-2018-0060","https://openalex.org/W2960685216","Soccer Performance, Predictive power, Tournament, Odds, Data set",1154.478,"Economics of Professional Sports and Prediction Markets","A hybrid random forest to predict soccer matches in international tournaments","2024-11-29T19:49:58.538410Z"
"Purpose: This study aimed to investigate if player tactical skill level and age category influence team performance and player exploratory behavior in tasks with different difficulty levels. Method: In total, 48 youth male soccer players participated in the study (U15, n = 24, mean age = 13.06 ± 1.53 years; U17, n = 24, mean age = 16.89 ± 0.11 years). Player tactical skills were evaluated through the System of Tactical Assessment in Soccer (FUT-SAT), allowing them to be organized into three groups according to tactical efficiency: Higher tactical skill level (Group 01), Intermediate tactical skill level (Group 02), and Lower tactical skill level (Group 03). Next, Group 01 and Group 03 of both categories performed six Small-Sided and Conditioned Games (SSCG) each, namely three High difficulty SSCGs and three Low difficulty SSCGs. Team performance and players' exploratory behavior were analyzed through the Offensive Sequences Characterization System and Lag Sequential Analysis, respectively. Results: We found that team performance and players' exploratory behavior were influenced both by the age and tactical skill level of the players, as well as by task difficulty level. Conclusion: Therefore, in an attempt to improve player performance, practitioners must carefully manipulate key task constraints to adapt training task difficulty levels to player age and tactical skill level.",72,"1","Tactics analysis","2024-11-29T19:50:30.068578Z","https://doi.org/10.1080/02701367.2019.1612511","https://openalex.org/W2948738825","Soccer Performance, Sport Psychology, Coaching Effectiveness, Training Load, Youth Sport Specialization",16.663,"Sports Science and Performance Analysis","How Does the Adjustment of Training Task Difficulty Level Influence Tactical Behavior in Soccer?","2024-11-29T19:50:30.068615Z"
"There is controversy in the literature in regards of the link between training load and injury rate. Thus, the aims of this non-interventional study were to evaluate relationships between pre-season training load with biochemical markers, injury incidence and performance during the first month of the competitive period in professional soccer players.Healthy professional soccer players were enrolled in this study over two pre-season periods. Data sets were available from 26 players during the first season (2014-2015) and 24 players during the second season (2015-2016) who completed two pre-season periods (6 weeks each). External training load was assessed from all athletes during training using Global Positioning System (GPS). Internal training load was monitored after each training session using rate of perceived exertion (RPE). Before and after each pre-season, blood samples were taken to determine plasma lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Injury incidence and overall performance (ranking of the team after the first five official games of the championship) were recorded for both seasons separately.There was no statistically significant difference in mean RPE values of the two-preparation periods (2737 ± 452 and 2629 ± 786 AU, p = 0.492). The correlational analysis did not reveal significant associations between internal and external training load (RPE and GPS data) and biological markers. There was a significant positive correlation between RPE and LDH during the 2015/2016 season (r = 0.974, p = 0.001). In addition, a significant negative correlation was found between total distance >20 km/h and CRP during the 2015-2016 season (r = -0.863, p = 0.027). The injury rates for the two seasons were 1.76 and 1.06 per 1000 h exposure for the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 seasons, respectively (p = 0.127).Our study showed that pre-season training load is not associated with overall team performance. This association is most likely multifactorial and other factors (e.g., technical and tactical level of the team, opponents, environment) may play an important role for the collective team performance. Our findings may help coaches to better prepare their athletes during pre-season.",73,"1","Medical / Injuries","2024-11-29T19:51:08.264223Z","https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.00409","https://openalex.org/W2940329046","Creatine kinase, Training Load, Match play, Athlete Monitoring, Soccer Performance, Perceived exertion",27.759,"Epidemiology of Sports-Related Musculoskeletal Injuries","Relationship of Pre-season Training Load With In-Season Biochemical Markers, Injuries and Performance in Professional Soccer Players","2024-11-29T19:51:08.264263Z"
"Small-sided conditioned games (SSCG) in soccer are games with a small number of players, often played on smaller than regular pitches and with adapted rules. It has been argued that SSCG foster soccer players’ physical, technical and tactical performances and creativity. This study tested the latter conjecture by analysing video-footage of individual actions of elite soccer players in 5 v 5, 6 v 6, 7 v 7 SSCG played during regular training sessions and 11-aside training matches. Based on the ecological dynamics approach, we hypothesized that smaller formats would result in players making more individual actions. We additionally anticipated that the smaller formats players would induce a larger repertoire of actions, that is, an increased variability of actions, and that such increase in variability would be associated with more creative actions. Along the same lines, we reasoned that midfielders would make more creative actions than defenders and attackers. We categorized 3555 soccer actions on the ball and without the ball of 24 elite soccer players. Players produced more actions in smaller SSCG formats compared to the larger SSCG format and the 11-aside match. They also produced more different actions in SSCG than the 11-aside match. Furthermore, ten creative actions (i.e., actions that were adequate and only made by one or two players) were discerned. The creative actions emerged most often in the smaller SSCG, and were absent in the 11-aside matches. Finally, strikers, defenders and midfielders did not show reliable differences in terms of number, variability and creativity of action. SSCG in soccer do indeed stimulate variability and creativity of individual actions. It is important to confirm whether these immediate effects of SSCG generalize across longer time scales.",74,"1","Scouting / Finance","2024-11-29T19:52:40.335834Z","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychsport.2019.101645","https://openalex.org/W2997318747","Aside, Soccer Performance, Elite, Sport Psychology, Coaching Effectiveness",79.296,"Sports Science and Performance Analysis","Variability and creativity in small-sided conditioned games among elite soccer players","2024-11-29T19:52:40.335869Z"
"Abstract Bromley, T, Turner, A, Read, P, Lake, J, Maloney, S, Chavda, S, and Bishop, C. Effects of a competitive soccer match on jump performance and interlimb asymmetries in elite academy soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 35(6): 1707–1714, 2021—The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a competitive soccer match on jump performance and interlimb asymmetries over incremental time points during a 72-hour period. Fourteen elite adolescent players from a professional English category 3 academy performed single-leg countermovement jumps pre, post, 24-, 48-, and 72-hour post-match on a single force platform. Eccentric impulse, concentric impulse, peak propulsive force, jump height, peak landing force, and landing impulse were monitored throughout. Interlimb asymmetries were also calculated for each metric as the percentage difference between limbs. Significant negative changes ( p &lt; 0.05) in jump performance were noted for all metrics at all time points, with the exception of jump height. Interlimb asymmetries were metric-dependent and showed very large increases, specifically post-match, with a trend to reduce back toward baseline values at the 48-hour time point for propulsive-based metrics. Asymmetries for landing metrics did not peak until the 24-hour time point and again reduced toward baseline at 48-hour time point. This study highlights the importance of monitoring distinct jump metrics, as jump height alone was not sensitive enough to show significant changes in jump performance. However, interlimb asymmetries were sensitive to fatigue with very large increases post-match. More frequent monitoring of asymmetries could enable practitioners to determine whether existing imbalances are also associated with reductions in physical performance or increased injury risk.",75,"1","Physical Attributes","2024-11-29T19:53:12.491365Z","https://doi.org/10.1519/jsc.0000000000002951","https://openalex.org/W2900561431","Soccer Performance, Athlete Monitoring, Training Load, Athletic Training, Sports Injury, Countermovement, Elite",19.151,"Sports Science and Performance Analysis","Effects of a Competitive Soccer Match on Jump Performance and Interlimb Asymmetries in Elite Academy Soccer Players","2024-11-29T19:53:12.491400Z"
"Prospective cohort.To explore the association between preseason assessments of (1) isometric hip adductor and abductor strength using a novel field test and (2) the Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS) and subsequent hip/groin injury in male professional soccer players.In total, 204 male elite soccer players from 10 professional A-League and English Football League Championship clubs underwent assessments of hip adductor and abductor strength and completed the HAGOS in the 2017-2018 preseason. All subsequent hip/groin injuries were reported by team medical staff. Data reduction was conducted using principal-component analysis. The principal component for the HAGOS and 3 principal components for strength and imbalance measures were entered, with age and prior hip/groin injury, into a multivariable logistic regression model to determine their association with prospectively occurring hip/groin injury.Twenty-four players suffered at least 1 hip/groin injury throughout the 2017-2018 season. The principal component for between-limb abduction imbalance (peak strength in the preferred kicking limb - nonpreferred limb) (odds ratio [OR] = 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.38, 0.90; P = .011), the principal component for peak adduction and abduction strength (OR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.51, 1.00; P = .045), and the principal component for the HAGOS (OR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.96; P = .022) were independently associated with a reduced risk of future hip/groin injury. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of the whole model revealed an area under the curve of 0.76, which indicates a fair combined sensitivity and specificity of the included variables but an inability to correctly identify all subsequently injured players.Hip abduction imbalance favoring the preferred kicking limb, higher levels of hip adductor and abductor strength, and superior HAGOS values were associated with a reduced likelihood of future hip/groin injury in male professional soccer players.

"We present 10 different strength-based statistical models that we use to model soccer match outcomes with the aim of producing a new ranking. The models are of four main types: Thurstone–Mosteller, Bradley–Terry, independent Poisson and bivariate Poisson, and their common aspect is that the parameters are estimated via weighted maximum likelihood, the weights being a match importance factor and a time depreciation factor giving less weight to matches that are played a long time ago. Since our goal is to build a ranking reflecting the teams’ current strengths, we compare the 10 models on the basis of their predictive performance via the Rank Probability Score at the level of both domestic leagues and national teams. We find that the best models are the bivariate and independent Poisson models. We then illustrate the versatility and usefulness of our new rankings by means of three examples where the existing rankings fail to provide enough information or lead to peculiar results.",78,"1","Innovative Technologies","2024-11-29T19:55:03.612598Z","https://doi.org/10.1177/1471082x18817650","https://openalex.org/W2964046272","Soccer Performance, Rank (graph theory), Factor analysis",17.836,"Economics of Professional Sports and Prediction Markets","Ranking soccer teams on the basis of their current strength: A comparison of maximum likelihood approaches","2024-11-29T19:55:03.612637Z"
"The present study investigated the effects of in-season enhanced negative work-based training (ENT) vs weight training in the change of direction (COD), sprinting and jumping ability, muscle mass and strength in semi-professional soccer players. Forty male soccer players participated in the eight-week, 1 d/w intervention consisting of 48 squat repetitions for ENT using a flywheel device (inertia=0.11 kg·m -2 ) or weight training (80%1 RM) as a control group (CON). Agility T-test, 20+20 m shuttle, 10 m and 30 m sprint, squat jump (SJ) and countermovement jump (CMJ), lean mass, quadriceps and hamstrings strength and the hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio were measured. Time on agility T-test and 20+20 m shuttle decreased in ENT (effect-size =-1.44, 95% CI -2.24/-0.68 and -0.75, -1.09/-0.42 respectively) but not in CON (-0.33, -0.87/0.19 and -0.13, -0.58/0.32).

Overall, quadriceps and hamstrings strength increased in both ENT and CON (0.38/0.79), but the hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio increased in ENT (0.31, 0.22/0.40) but not in CON (0.03, -0.18/0.24). Lean mass increased in both ENT (0.41, 0.26/0.57) and CON (0.29, 0.14/0.44).

"The main factors for home advantage (HA), quantified by the number of points won at home expressed as a percentage of all points, are believed to be crowd support, territoriality, familiarity, and travel fatigue. In 2020, the German Soccer Bundesliga interrupted its championship due to the Covid-19 pandemic after 25 rounds and the last nine rounds were played without audience. This unique situation allowed studying the effect of spectators on the team's performance and the referee's decisions. We hypothesized a decrease in HA and a more balanced distribution of fouls and disciplinary cards in the games without audience (GWOA) compared to the games with audience (GWA). We evaluated <italic>n</italic> = 223 GWA and <italic>n</italic> = 83 GWOA of the season 2019/20 and all games of the preceding season 2018/19 to analyze the distribution of game outcomes (wins, losses, and draws) and HA. We analyzed the number of fouls, disciplinary cards, and penalty kicks. We found significant differences in HA between GWA (HA = 54.35%) and GWOA (HA = 44.1%) as well as GWOA and games of 2018/19 (HA = 57.63%). The distribution of game outcomes in GWOA did not differ from GWA but differed significantly from 2018/19 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.031). The distribution of fouls showed a significant difference to equal distribution in GWA [home: 2,595 (48.56%); away: 2,749 (51.44%)] but not in GWOA [home: 1,067 (50.54%); away: 1,044 (49.46%)]. In the GWOA, we counted 178 (51.1%, home) and 170 (48.9%, away) cards, representing a significant difference in the distribution to GWA [home: 405 (44.85%); away: 498 (55.15%)]. The number of red cards differed significantly from an equal distribution for GWA (14 home and 28 away) but not for GWOA (eight home and seven away). In the last nine rounds without audience, we observed more home losses (36) than home wins (27). Hence, the Covid-19 lock-down led to a home disadvantage. One reason for this surprising result could be that the home team is missing an important familiar aspect when playing in their empty stadium without social support from their home audience. Furthermore, both teams know about the HA thus the away team could be more motivated in this unusual situation.",80,"1","Other","2024-11-29T19:56:33.095908Z","https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2020.593499","https://openalex.org/W3097055805","Disadvantage, 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak, Home Advantage",31.733,"Economics of Professional Sports and Prediction Markets","Covid-19 Has Turned Home Advantage Into Home Disadvantage in the German Soccer Bundesliga","2024-11-29T19:56:33.095944Z"
"The aim of the present study was (a) to describe the anthropometric profile of a large group of soccer players based on different age groups and their playing positions on the field, and (b) to examine the variations of body composition among adult soccer players using diverse equations based on skinfold thickness. A total of 618 Greek soccer players who were grouped by age (i.e., 12–14, 14–16, 16–18, and 18–37 years) and playing position (i.e., goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, and forward) were evaluated for weight, height, and skinfolds. The Pařízková formula was used to estimate the percentage of body fat. Furthermore, for players who were 18 years or older the Reilly and Evans formulas was used to estimate the percentage of body fat. Independent of the age, in this large sample, goalkeepers presented higher values for weight, height and the percentage of body fat estimation as compared with other field positions. An anthropometric pattern was observed in each tactical position, namely, across a specific age of increasing maturation process (14–16 years). With the Pařízková formula, we found a mean (SD) range of variation in the percentage of body fat estimation between 4.87 ± 1.46 and 5.51 ± 1.46 as compared with the Evans formula. The same pattern of differences was found when the Reilly equation was considered. In conclusion, we observed a position specificity of anthropometric characteristics across different age categories.

"Abstract Purpose To examine the prevalence of disordered eating (DE) in elite male and female soccer players and the influence of perfectionism. Methods Using a cross-sectional design, elite male ( n = 137) and female ( n = 70) soccer players and non-athlete controls ( n = 179) completed the clinical perfectionism questionnaire (CPQ-12) and the eating attitudes test (EAT-26) to assess perfectionism and DE risk, respectively. Results Male soccer players had higher EAT-26 scores than controls (10.4 ± 9.9 vs. 6.8 ± 6.7; P = 0.001), but there were no differences in the prevalence of clinical levels of DE (EAT-26 score ≥ 20) (15 vs. 5%, respectively; X 2 = 0.079) The proportion of females with DE risk was higher in controls [EAT-26: 13.9 ± 11.6 (25% of population)] than female players [EAT-26: 10.0 ± 9.0% (11% of population)] ( X 2 = 0.001). With linear regression, perfectionism explained 20% of the variation in DE risk in males ( P = 0.001); in females, athletic status (player vs. control) and perfectionism were significant predictors of DE risk, explaining 21% of the variation ( P = 0.001). Male reserve team players had higher EAT-26 (+ 3.5) and perfectionism (+ 2.7) scores than first-team players ( P &lt; 0.05). There were no differences in the prevalence of DE risk between the male and female soccer players ( X 2 = 0.595).

"Due to the low scoring nature of football (soccer), shots are often used as a proxy to evaluate team and player performances. However, not all shots are created equally and their quality differs significantly depending on the situation. The aim of this study is to objectively quantify the quality of any given shot by introducing a so-called expected goals (xG) model. This model is validated statistically and with professional match analysts. The best performing model uses an extreme gradient boosting algorithm and is based on hand-crafted features from synchronized positional and event data of 105, 627 shots in the German Bundesliga. With a ranked probability score (RPS) of 0.197, it is more accurate than any previously published expected goals model. This approach allows us to assess team and player performances far more accurately than is possible with traditional metrics by focusing on process rather than results.",83,"1","Innovative Technologies","2024-11-29T19:58:30.161698Z","https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2021.624475","https://openalex.org/W3147122783","Soccer Performance, Proxy (statistics), Football team, Boosting (machine learning), Event data",9.686,"Economics of Professional Sports and Prediction Markets","A Goal Scoring Probability Model for Shots Based on Synchronized Positional and Event Data in Football (Soccer)","2024-11-29T19:58:30.161733Z"
"The purpose of this study was to test the relationships between training workload (WL) parameters with variations in anaerobic power and change of direction (COD) in under-16 soccer players. Twenty-three elite players under 16 years were daily monitored for their WL across 20 weeks during the competition soccer season. Additionally, players were assessed three times for anthropometric, body composition, COD, and anaerobic power. A correlational analysis between the mean differences between assessments and accumulated WL parameters were conducted. Moreover, a regression analysis was executed to explain the variations in the percentage of change in fitness levels considering the accumulated WL parameters and peak height velocity. The accumulated daily loads during one week showed a large and a moderate correlation with peak power and COD at different periods of the season. Regression analysis showed no significant predictions for COD (F(12, 10) = 1.2, p = 0.41) prediction, acute load (F(12, 10) = 0.63, p = 0.78), or chronic load (F(12, 10) = 0.59, p = 0.81). In conclusion, it may be assumed that the values of the chronic workload and the accumulated training monotony can be used to better explain the physical capacities of young soccer players, suggesting the importance of psychophysiological instruments to identify the effects of the training process in this population.",84,"1","Physical Attributes","2024-11-29T19:58:51.416185Z","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17217934","https://openalex.org/W3096176300","Training Load, Athlete Development, Athlete Monitoring, Sport Psychology, Soccer Performance",10.209,"Sports Science and Performance Analysis","Relationships Between Training Workload Parameters with Variations in Anaerobic Power and Change of Direction Status in Elite Youth Soccer Players","2024-11-29T19:58:51.416224Z"
"This study investigated anthropometric measures and growth as risk factors for overuse and acute injuries in younger (U10-U12) and older (U13-U15) elite level soccer players.Prospective cohort study.Height, weight, and sitting height were measured at the start and the end of the 2016-2017 competitive season and growth velocities were calculated. Throughout the season, injuries were registered continuously by the (para-)medical staff of the included clubs. We analyzed the injury risk using multilevel Poisson regression models, accounting for club and team clustering.Of the included 314 players (11.7±1.7 years of age), 160 players sustained 133 overuse and 163 acute injuries (i.e. 106 injuries in 69 players of the younger group, 190 in 91 players of the older group). In the younger group, risk of overuse injuries was associated with an increase in leg length over the season (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.620 [95% CI 1.230-2.117]) and risk of acute injuries with relatively younger age (IRR 1.003 [95% CI 1.000-1.006]). In the older group, a higher leg length was associated with an increased risk of overuse injuries (IRR 1.055 [95% CI 1.011-1.108]), and a higher weight and a lower growth rate with an increased risk of acute injuries (IRR 1.043 [95% CI 1.021-1.067] and 0.903 [95% CI 0.831-0.981], respectively).Injury risk factors differ by age group and type of injury. The age-specific anthropometric and growth-related risk factors should be monitored and these risk profiles should be considered to manage injury risk effectively.",85,"1","Medical / Injuries","2024-11-29T19:59:12.131228Z","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.10.001","https://openalex.org/W2979436628","Rate ratio, Training Load, Athlete Monitoring, Sports Injury, Soccer Performance, Youth Athletes",12.559,"Epidemiology of Sports-Related Musculoskeletal Injuries","Risk of acute and overuse injuries in youth elite soccer players: Body size and growth matter","2024-11-29T19:59:12.131284Z"

"Success in different soccer skills like kicking depends on motor abilities achieved. Kicking is a soccer fundamental, which depends on many different and complex factors (technique, foot-ball interaction, ball flight, etc.). Therefore, it is important to identify players that are able to perform faster kicks using both dominant and non-dominant leg. The current study investigated some basic variables of different soccer kicking speed and their relevance to success in youth soccer academy. 119 players from the first and the second division participated to this study. They were randomly divided into age groups (U-15, U-17, and U19) and team status (first team, reserves). The diagnostic ability of the different ball kicking speed tests in capturing differences between first team players and reserves among different age categories were computed using the receiver operating characteristics analysis. Results demonstrated that first team players achieved better results when comparing to reserves in each category. In addition, differences were greater in the U-15 and the U-17 than in the U-19 age group.

"Fatigue has been proposed to increase the risk of knee injury. This study tracked countermovement jump, knee isometric strength, and kinetics and kinematics in 8 female soccer players (experimental group) during an anticipated sidestep maneuver before and after two matches played over a 43-h period. Time points were: Before and after match 1 (T0 and T1), 12 h after the first match (T2), and immediately after the second match (T3). A control group participated only in practice sessions. Isometric knee extension strength decreased by 14.8% at T2 (p = 0.003), but knee flexion was not affected until T3, declining by 12.6% (p = 0.018). During the sidestep maneuver, knee joint degrees of flexion at initial contact was increased by 17.1% at T3, but maximum knee and hip angle at initial contact were unchanged. Peak resultant ground reaction force (GRF) increased by 12.6% (p = 0.047) at T3 (3.03 xBW) from 2.69 xBW at T0, while posterior GRF was significantly higher than T0 at all three subsequent time points (T1 = 0.82 ± 0.23 xBW, T2 = 0.87 ± 0.22 xBW, T3 = 0.89 ± 0.22 xBW). Anterior tibial shear force increased significantly (p = 0.020) at T3 (1.24 ± 0.12 xBW) compared to T1 (1.15 ± 0.13 xBW), an 8.8% increase. Lateral tibial shear force was significantly higher at both T1 (0.95 ± 0.20 xBW) and T3 (1.15 ± 0.38 xBW) compared to T0 (0.67 ± 0.25 xBW).

"The expected possession value (EPV) of a soccer possession represents the likelihood of a team scoring or receiving the next goal at any time instance. By decomposing the EPV into a series of subcomponents that are estimated separately, we develop a comprehensive analysis framework providing soccer practitioners with the ability to evaluate the impact of both observed and potential actions. We show we can obtain calibrated models for all the components of EPV, including a set of yet-unexplored problems in soccer. We produce visually-interpretable probability surfaces for potential passes from a series of deep neural network architectures that learn from low-level spatiotemporal data.

"Abstract NOTE: The first page of text has been automatically extracted and included below in lieu of an abstract Session: Mobile Robots and Interdisciplinary Design 2220 Robot Soccer: A Platform for Systems Engineering Raffaello D'Andrea Cornell University Abstract This paper describes a project course at Cornell University aimed at educating students in Systems Engineering. The multidisciplinary nature of the course is a great vehicle for highlighting some of the key components of Systems Engineering, including System Design, Systems and Technology Integration, Systems Analysis, and System Engineering Management. The class is comprised of twenty-four students from Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Operations Research and Industrial Engineering, and Computer Science. I. Introduction As engineering systems become more and more complex, there is an increasing need from industry for engineers who not only have expertise in a particular engineering discipline, but who also possess diverse interdisciplinary skills, can integrate system components, can ensure total system operability, and can understand the various economic forces in the marketplace. This skill set and process is often referred to as Systems Engineering (SE). In order to effectively teach SE principles to students, a project course that embodies many of the key elements of SE, is being developed. The project entails the construction of fully autonomous, fast moving robots which will work together as a team in an effort to compete against similar teams of robots in a robotic soccer match This yearly competition, known as the Robot World Cup Initiative (or simply RoboCup), is described below. The RoboCup is an international research and education initiative. It is an attempt to foster robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) research by providing a standard problem where wide range of technologies can be integrated and examined, as well as being used for integrated project-oriented education. Due to its international appeal and suitability to this task, the platform chosen was soccer. In order for a robot team to actually play soccer, various technologies must be incorporated including: robotics, sensor fusion, design principles of autonomous agents, multi-agent collaboration, strategy acquisition, and real-time reasoning. A description of this competition may be found at www.robocup.org, and the rules are briefly summarized in the Appendix. The soccer matches are played on a regulation size table-tennis table by teams composed of five robots. Similar to the real game of soccer, the objective is to score more goals than the opponent subject to well-defined rules and regulations. The robots are permitted to communicate to each",90,"1","Innovative Technologies","2024-11-29T20:03:21.532954Z","https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--7927","https://openalex.org/W2731209424","Modeling and Simulation, Simulation Optimization, Hybrid Optimization, Parallel Simulation Systems, Discrete-Event Simulation",13.345,"Self-Reconfigurable Robotic Systems and Modular Robotics","Robot Soccer: A Platform For Systems Engineering","2024-11-29T20:03:21.532990Z"

"The purpose of this study was to quantify possible differences in sprint mechanical outputs in soccer according to soccer playing standard, position, age and sex. Sprint tests of 674 male and female players were analysed. Theoretical maximal velocity (v0), horizontal force (F0), horizontal power (Pmax), force-velocity slope (SFV), ratio of force (RFmax) and index of force application technique (DRF) were calculated from anthropometric and spatiotemporal data using an inverse dynamic approach applied to the centre-of-mass movement. Players of higher standard exhibited superior F0, v0, Pmax, RFmax and DRF scores (small to large effects) than those of lower standard. Forwards displayed clearly superior values for most outputs, ahead of defenders, midfielders and goalkeepers, respectively. Male >28 y players achieved poorer v0, Pmax and RFmax than <20, 20–24 and 24–28 y players (small to moderate), while female <20 y players showed poorer values than 20–24 and >24 y players for the same measures (small). The sex differences in sprint mechanical properties ranged from small to very large. These results provide a holistic picture of the force-velocity-power profile continuum in sprinting soccer players and serve as useful background information for practitioners when diagnosing individual players and prescribing training programmes.",92,"1","Physical Attributes","2024-11-29T20:04:23.144330Z","https://doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2020.1741955","https://openalex.org/W3012540785","Sprint, Soccer Performance, Athlete Monitoring, Performance Analysis, Position (finance)",19.67,"Sports Science and Performance Analysis","Sprint mechanical properties in soccer players according to playing standard, position, age and sex","2024-11-29T20:04:23.144369Z"
"Context : Hamstring strain injury (HSI) is the most prevalent injury in football (soccer), and a few intrinsic factors have been associated with higher injury rates. Objective : To describe the prevalence of the main intrinsic risk factors for HSI in professional and under-20 football players. Design : Cross-sectional study. Setting : Physiotherapy laboratory, Federal University of Health Sciences of Porto Alegre (Brazil). Participants : A total of 101 football players (52 professional and 49 under-20 players). Intervention : An evidence-based testing protocol for screening HSI risk factors. Main Outcome Measures : Anamnesis, ultrasonography of the hamstrings, passive straight-leg raise test, Functional Movement Screen, and isokinetic dynamometry were performed. Eleven HSI risk factors for each leg were assessed, besides the player’s age as a systemic risk factor. Reports were delivered to the coaching staff. Results : Professionals had greater prevalence of HSI history compared with under-20 players (40% vs 18%). No between-group differences were found for the other screening tests. Altogether, 30% of players had already sustained at least one HSI; 58% had a history of injuries in adjacent regions; 49% had short biceps femoris fascicles; 66% and 21% had poor passive and active flexibility, respectively; 42% and 29% had deficits in functional movements and core stability, respectively; 7% and 26% presented bilateral imbalance for hamstring concentric and eccentric strength, respectively; 87% and 94% obtained low values for hamstring-to-quadriceps conventional and functional ratios, respectively. Two-thirds of players had 3 to 5 risk factors per leg. None of the players was fully free of HSI risk factors. Conclusion : Most football players present multiple risk factors for sustaining an HSI. Hamstring weakness is the most prevalent risk factor, but the teams should also be aware of deficits in flexibility, core stability, functional movements, and hamstring fascicle length.",93,"1","Medical / Injuries","2024-11-29T20:04:43.540153Z","https://doi.org/10.1123/jsr.2018-0084","https://openalex.org/W2914658941","Core stability, Hamstring injury, Hamstring Strain, Straight leg raise, Sports Injury",8.332,"Epidemiology of Sports-Related Musculoskeletal Injuries","Prevalence of Hamstring Strain Injury Risk Factors in Professional and Under-20 Male Football (Soccer) Players","2024-11-29T20:04:43.540190Z"
"BACKGROUND: The rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection required general confinement measures reducing or even preventing sport practice, which was a risk of detraining in athletes. In adolescents, detraining is poorly known as well as its prevention by home-exercises. This article aimed to assess the effects of COVID-19 confinement on detraining in young high-level soccer players despite a multimodal training program conducted at home.METHODS: Twenty-five elite soccer players, aged 14, were included to perform physical exercises at home during the COVID-19 confinement. Two cardio-training sessions and two upper and lower limb muscle strengthening sessions were performed per week. The exercise program was monitored remotely via the web. Hooper, training and mental indexes allowed a psychological follow-up. The effect of COVID-19 confinement on aerobic capacity was measured using a pre- and postconfinement Yo-Yo Test.RESULTS: Out of the 25 adolescences who completed the exercises program, 19 performed the postconfinement Yo-Yo Test. The running distance decreased by 614+/-630 m (-25%) (P=0001) and the maximal running speed by 0.97+/-1 km/h (-5%) (P=0.001), confirming detraining. Hooper, training and mental indexes remained stable showing a well-supported home COVID-19 confinement.CONCLUSIONS: The 2-month period of strict home confinement due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was responsible for a decrease of aerobic abilities in adolescent soccer players, despite a remotely monitored multimodal exercises program.",94,"1","Other","2024-11-29T20:05:20.043819Z","https://doi.org/10.23736/s0022-4707.20.11669-4","https://openalex.org/W3110126936","Athlete Monitoring, Exercise Capacity, Training Load, Aerobic exercise, Elite athletes, 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak, Elite",12.708,"Sports Science and Performance Analysis","Effects of the COVID-19 confinement period on physical conditions in young elite soccer players","2024-11-29T20:05:20.043860Z"
"This study investigated whether the addition of eight weeks of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) to a regular preseason soccer training program, including incremental endurance training (IET), would change pulmonary function, lung ventilation, and aerobic performance in young soccer players. Sixteen club-level competitive junior soccer players (mean age 17.63 ± 0.48 years, height 182 ± 0.05 cm, body mass 68.88 ± 4.48 kg) participated in the study. Participants were randomly assigned into two groups: experimental (n = 8) and control (n = 8). Both groups performed regular preseason soccer training, including endurance workouts as IET. In addition to this training, the experimental group performed additional IMT for eigght weeks with a commercially available respiratory muscle trainer (Threshold IMT), with a total of 80 inhalations (twice per day, five days per week). Pre- and post-intervention tests of pulmonary function, maximal inspiratory pressure, and the Cooper test were implemented. Eight weeks of IMT had a positive impact on expiratory muscle strength (p = 0.001); however, there was no significant effect on respiratory function parameters.

"Group activity detection in soccer can be done by using either video data or player and ball trajectory data. In current soccer activity datasets, activities are labelled as atomic events without a duration. Given that the state-of-the-art activity detection methods are not well-defined for atomic actions, these methods cannot be used. In this work, we evaluated the effectiveness of activity recognition models for detecting such events, by using an intuitive non-maximum suppression process and evaluation metrics. We also considered the problem of explicitly modeling interactions between players and ball. For this, we propose self-attention models to learn and extract relevant information from a group of soccer players for activity detection from both trajectory and video data. We conducted an extensive study on the use of visual features and trajectory data for group activity detection in sports using a large scale soccer dataset provided by Sportlogiq. Our results show that most events can be detected using either vision or trajectory-based approaches with a temporal resolution of less than 0.5 seconds, and that each approach has unique challenges.",96,"1","Innovative Technologies","2024-11-29T20:06:18.761438Z","https://doi.org/10.1109/cvprw50498.2020.00457","https://openalex.org/W3035717782","Activity detection, Motion Detection, Human Activity Analysis, Action Recognition, Activity recognition, Object Tracking, Multiple Object Tracking, Ball (mathematics)",14.65,"Human Action Recognition and Pose Estimation","Group Activity Detection from Trajectory and Video Data in Soccer","2024-11-29T20:06:18.761476Z"
"The aim of this study was to examine the effects of coordination training using an agility ladder compared with a control group on physical fitness and technical performance in youth soccer players. Eighteen male youth soccer players (age: 12.2 ± 0.4 years; body height: 158.3 ± 10.8 cm; body mass: 45.0 ± 8.0 kg) were randomly assigned to an agility ladder group (n = 10) or a control group (n = 8). The intervention program was carried out three times a week over six weeks. Before and after the training period, the 10 m sprint, 20 m sprint, dribbling speed test, agility test, and slalom dribbling test performances were assessed. Within-group analysis showed significant improvements (p < 0.005) in 10 m and 20 m sprint performance from the pre- to the post-test for the agility ladder group (-2.39% and -2.10%) and the control group (-2.54% and -1.44%). No significant differences (p > 0.005) were found from the pre- to the post-test in the dribbling speed test, agility test, slalom dribbling test, and skill index. In the between-group analysis, there were no differences between the agility ladder group and the control group in any variable. In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest coordination training with an agility ladder does not seem to be effective to improve physical fitness and dribbling.

"Subjective and objective assessments may be used congruently when making decisions regarding player recruitment in soccer, yet there have been few attempts to examine the level of agreement between these methods. Therefore, we compare levels of agreement between subjective and objective assessments of physical qualities associated with youth soccer performance. In total, 80 male youth soccer players (13.2 ± 1.9 years), and 12 professional coaches volunteered to participate. Players were objectively assessed using five fitness measures: Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test Level 1; Countermovement vertical jump; Functional Movement Screen™; 5/20 m sprint; alongside anthropometric measures. Additionally, coaches subjectively rated each player on the same five physical qualities using 5-point Likert scales. Inter-rater agreement between ratings from lead and assistant coaches was established for each age group. Moreover, Bayesian regression models were fitted to determine how well coach ratings were able to predict fitness test performance. Although inter-rater agreement between lead and assistant coaches was moderate-to-substantial (ω = 0.48–0.68), relationships between coaches subjective rating’s and corresponding fitness test performance were only highly related for the highest and lowest performing players.

"Background: Wearable sensor systems have the potential to quantify head kinematic responses of head impacts in soccer. However, on-field use of sensors (eg, accelerometers) remains challenging, owing to poor coupling to the head and difficulties discriminating low-severity direct head impacts from inertial loading of the head from human movements, such as jumping and landing. Purpose: To test the validity of an in-ear sensor for quantifying head impacts in youth soccer. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: First, the sensor was mounted to a Hybrid III headform and impacted with a linear impactor or a soccer ball. Peak linear acceleration (PLA), peak rotational acceleration (PRA), and peak rotational velocity (PRV) were obtained from both systems; random and systematic errors were calculated with Hybrid III as reference. Then, 6 youth soccer players wore sensors and performed a structured training protocol, including heading and nonheading exercises; they also completed 2 regular soccer sessions. For each accelerative event recorded, PLA, PRA, and PRV outputs were compared with video recordings. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine the sensor’s discriminatory capacity in both on-field settings, establishing cutoff values for predicting outcomes. Results: For the laboratory tests, the random error was 11% for PLA, 20% for PRA, and 5% for PRV; the systematic error was 11%, 19%, and 5%, respectively. For the structured training protocol, heading events resulted in higher absolute values (PLA = 15.6 g± 11.8 g) than nonheading events (PLA = 4.6 g± 1.2 g); the area under the curve was 0.98 for PLA. In regular training sessions, the area under the curve was &gt;0.99 for PLA. A 9 g cutoff value yielded a positive predictive value of 100% in the structured training protocol versus 65% in the regular soccer sessions. Conclusion: The in-ear sensor displayed considerable random error and substantially overestimated head impact exposure. Despite the sensor’s excellent on-field accuracy for discriminating headings from other accelerative events in youth soccer, absolute values must be interpreted with caution, and there is a need for secondary means of verification (eg, video analysis) in real-life settings. Clinical Relevance: Wearable sensor systems can potentially provide valuable insights into head impact exposures in contact sports, but their limitations require careful consideration.",99,"1","Innovative Technologies","2024-11-29T20:08:49.603375Z","https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546519826953","https://openalex.org/W2916753495","Head Impact",32.279,"Biomechanics of Traumatic Brain Injury","Evaluation of an In-Ear Sensor for Quantifying Head Impacts in Youth Soccer","2024-11-29T20:08:49.603416Z"
"Despite empirical observations suggesting that practitioners value the use of substitutions during soccer match-play, limited research has sought to substantiate such claims. This study used online surveys to assess the perceptions of practitioners within professional soccer about the use and practices of substitutes. Thirty-three practitioners completed one of two surveys (each requiring both open and closed questions to be answered), depending upon whether their primary role related mostly to tactical ('tactical practitioners'; n = 7) or physical ('physical practitioners'; n = 26) aspects of player/team management. Thematic content analysis of responses identified four higher-order themes: 'impact of substitutions', 'planning and communication', 'player preparation and recovery' and 'regulations'. Eighty-five percent of practitioners believed that substitutes are important in determining success during soccer match-play, with the primary justification being the perceived ability of such players to provide a physical and/or tactical impact. However, contextual factors such as the match situation, timing of introduction, and players undergoing adequate pre-pitch-entry preparation, may be important for realising such aims. Although many practitioners believed that there was a need for substitutes to engage in bespoke non-match-day preparations and recovery strategies that differ from starting players, logistical considerations, such as scarcity of resources, often limit their scope. Notwithstanding, 96% of respondents indicated that substitutes frequently perform extra conditioning sessions to account for deficits in high-speed running loads compared with players exposed to a longer period of match-play. Substitutes' pre-match warm-ups are typically led by team staff, however practitioners reported providing varying levels of input with regards to the practices adopted between kick-off and pitch-entry. Uncertainty exists as to the efficacy of current pre-pitch-entry practices, and 100% of practitioners highlighted 'preparatory strategies' as at least a 'moderately important' direction for future research. This study presents novel insights and highlights areas that are considered future research priorities amongst those working in the field.",100,"1","Tactics analysis","2024-11-29T20:09:48.192054Z","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228790","https://openalex.org/W3004761102","Bespoke, Thematic analysis, Sport Psychology, Soccer Performance, Coaching Effectiveness",39.976,"Sports Science and Performance Analysis","Practitioner perceptions regarding the practices of soccer substitutes","2024-11-29T20:09:48.192089Z"
"Abstract Objective Bio-banding (BB) has been introduced to account for varying maturity and to improve the talent development of junior soccer players. To date, research that investigated the physiological and technical effects of BB is sparse. Therefore, the aim of the study was to compare effects of BB with CA on selected technical and tactical parameters in U13 and U14 soccer players. Results BB significantly increased the number of duels ( p = 0.024) and set pieces ( p = 0.025) compared to chronological age. The mean time of ball possession per action was reduced ( p = 0.021) and the rate of successful passes was lower with BB ( p = 0.001). Meanwhile, the total number of passes was unaffected ( p = 0.796), and there was a trend towards a lower difference in ball possession between BB teams ( p = 0.058). In addition, BB reduced the distances covered while jogging ( p = 0.001), running ( p = 0.038) and high-speed running ( p = 0.035). With BB, an increased number of duels, unsuccessful passes and set pieces resulted in a quicker change of match play situations between teams. While physical demand was reduced, BB seems to result in a more technically and tactically challenging game.

"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of styles of play in soccer and the influence of contextual variables (i.e. match status, venue and quality of opposition). Team possessions ( n = 68,766) from the 380 matches of the 2015–2016 English Premier League season were collected for this study. The Possession Effectiveness Index, based on Expected Goals and Ball Movement Points metrics, was used to measure the effectiveness of team possessions. Linear mixed models were applied to analyse the influence of contextual variables on the effectiveness score for each style. Results showed that the effectiveness of Direct Play, Counterattack, Maintenance and Crossing significantly increased when teams were winning by two or more goals. Counterattack increased its effectiveness when teams were winning by one goal and reduced its effectiveness when losing by one goal. The effectiveness of Direct Play increased when losing by two goals or more. Playing away negatively affected the effectiveness of Direct Play, Maintenance and High Pressure. In addition, playing against a stronger opposition reduced the effectiveness of all styles of play.

"Sleep and mood are critical factors that contribute to health and wellness and are of particular interest to collegiate athletes who are juggling high physical, academic, and social demands. The aim of this study was to examine how psychological measures, player status, and sex-related factors were associated with perceived sleep quality.Higher levels of global sleep dysfunction will be related to poor mood and increased anxiety, and there will be differences in sleep dysfunction in male compared with female athletes as well as regarding playing status.Prospective cohort study.Level 4.During the 2016 through 2018 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) seasons, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Profile of Mood States, and Sports Anxiety Scale-2 questionnaires were administered to 230 soccer athletes at 6 separate time points throughout each season.PSQI results yielded scores ≥5 in 54% of observations. Increased sleep dysfunction was significantly related to decreased vigor and increased tension, depression, anger, fatigue, somatic anxiety, worry, and concentration disruption, although effect sizes (ES) were trivial (ES, -0.03 to 0.15). The odds ratio (OR) of reporting global sleep dysfunction increased by 8%, 9%, and 25% for every 1-unit increase in tension (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.16; P = 0.015), fatigue (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.16; P = 0.002), and concentration disruption (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.09-1.45; P = 0.002), respectively.

"The relative age effect (RAE) is associated with (dis)advantages in competitive sports. While the RAE in elite male soccer reveals a skewed birthdate distribution in relation to a certain cut-off date, research of RAE in elite female soccer is affected by small number of samples and conflicting results. The purpose of this study was to investigate the RAE in elite adult German soccer regarding gender and competition level. The sample comprised 680 female and 1,083 male players of the two top German leagues during the 2019/20 season and German national teams (A-Team to Under 19). Differences between the observed and expected birthdate distributions were analyzed using chi-square statistics and effect sizes followed by calculating odds ratios. Results showed a statistically significant RAE with small effect size across all players included for both genders (female players: P &amp;lt; 0.001, W = 0.16, male players: P &amp;lt; 0.001, W = 0.23). The identified RAE was based on an over-representation of players born at the beginning of the year. According to gender and competition level, RAEs were more pronounced in German male soccer. While significant RAEs were found among males in the first two leagues (first league: P &amp;lt; 0.001, W = 0.19, second league: P &amp;lt; 0.001, W = 0.26), the RAE of females was more pronounced in the second league (first league: P = 0.080, W = 0.16, second league: P = 0.002, W = 0.20).

"This study aims to expand the process of tactical assessment of soccer players through the development and validation of a video-based test based on core tactical principles of play. The TacticUP video test for soccer is composed of offensive and defensive video sequences of 11vs11 soccer situations. Participants should choose the most appropriate solution for each video sequence. Content validity was established based on a panel of nine experts from four different countries. Construct validity was assessed through the comparison between players with distinct expertise levels. Comparisons between groups' final scores showed statistical differences (p < 0.05) in 10 out of the 15 variables assessed, in which the expert group displayed higher values compared to the non-expert group. Face validity examined the acceptability and suitability of the test by players. Reliability was determined through the test-retest method for each video sequence, and Cohen's Kappa values ranged from 0.622 to 1.0. Therefore, the TacticUP video test showed adequate content, construct, and face validity and was a reliable measure of perceptual-cognitive and decision-making skills in soccer. We overcame limitations from previous video-based tests in soccer by introducing situations concerning off-the-ball movements in both offensive and defensive phases. The practical applications of this test are: (i) it can be used to monitor players' perceptual-cognitive and decision-making skills; (ii) the test is based on players' response selection in a video-based test, which enables the measurement of their perceptual-cognitive and decision-making skills based on the core tactical principles of play; (iii) generate players' tactical profile considering their perceptual-cognitive and decision-making skills based on core tactical principles of play; and (iv) measure the effectiveness of intervention/training programs on the development of perceptual-cognitive and decision-making skills.",108,"1","Tactics analysis","2024-11-29T20:19:35.625330Z","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01690","https://openalex.org/W3047486368","Face validity, Offensive, Soccer Performance, Coaching Effectiveness, Content validity",81.275,"Sports Science and Performance Analysis","TacticUP Video Test for Soccer: Development and Validation","2024-11-29T20:19:44.998037Z"

"The massive growth of sports videos, specially in soccer, has resulted in a need for the automatic generation of summaries, where the objective is not only to show the most important actions of the match but also to elicit as much emotion as the ones bring upon by human editors. State-of-the-art methods on video summarization mostly rely on video processing, however this is not an optimal approach for long videos such as soccer matches. In this paper we propose a multimodal approach to automatically generate summaries of soccer match videos that consider both event and audio features. The event features get a shorter and better representation of the match, and the audio helps detect the excitement generated by the game. Our method consists of three consecutive stages: Proposals, Summarization and Content Refinement. The first one generates summary proposals, using Multiple Instance Learning to deal with the similarity between the events inside the summary and the rest of the match. The Summarization stage uses event and audio features as input of a hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network to decide which proposals should indeed be in the summary. And the last stage, takes advantage of the visual content to create the final summary. The results show that our approach outperforms by a large margin not only the video processing methods but also methods that use event and audio features.",111,"1","Innovative Technologies","2024-11-29T20:21:33.994355Z","https://doi.org/10.1145/3347318.3355524","https://openalex.org/W2980884691","Video Summarization, Soccer Video, Margin (machine learning), Multimedia Synchronization, Similarity (geometry), Audio Event Detection, Representation (politics)",17.78,"Automatic Video Summarization and Analysis","A Deep Architecture for Multimodal Summarization of Soccer Games","2024-11-29T20:21:33.994390Z"
"The speed performance is involved not only in linear sprints, but also in a wide spectrum of multi-directional movements, such as curve sprinting. Curved sprint can be defined as sprint with gradual and continuous change of direction (COD). Although ~85% of the actions performed at maximum velocity in a professional soccer league are curvilinear sprints, there is not any specific test to assess this ability. This study aimed to analyse the reliability of a new curve sprint test, and compare its results with those obtained by soccer players in linear sprint. Forty experienced soccer players performed 3 attempts of curve sprint (using the penalty arc) to right and left side (17 m), and 3 linear sprints (17 m) in two different days. The ICCs (inter-session reliability) were 0.93 for sprint curve right side (CSRS) and 0.89 for sprint curve left side (CSLS), considered “acceptable”. The CVs (intra-session reliability) were 0.87% in CSRS and 1.15% in CSLS. The coefficient of determination (R2) between linear and curve sprinting was ~35%. The association between curve sides was “very large” (r = 0.878; p < 0.01).

"Objective: Since the observation of several deaths from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) among Italian professional soccer players, an association between ALS and soccer has been postulated. The objective of the study is to investigate the association between professional soccer and the risk of ALS in a large cohort of former professional soccer players with prolonged follow-up. Methods: All professional soccer players practicing in the period 1959–2000 were identified through the archives of an Italian soccer cards publisher. For each player, date and place of birth, playing role, and team history were recorded. Each player was followed since 15 years of age. Incident ALS cases were all soccer players first diagnosed during the period 1959–2018. The expected incidence rate was the number of ALS cases/100,000 person-years expected in the cohort. SIR was the ratio between observed and expected incidence rate. Results: 34 ALS cases were detected. The number of expected cases was 17.8. The SIR was 1.91 (95% CI 1.32–2.67) in the entire sample and 4.66 (95% CI 2.66–7.57) in subjects aged less than 45 years. The mean age at diagnosis was 45.0 years. Compared to the mean age of onset of ALS in the general population (65.2 years), the disease in former soccer players occurred 20.2 years earlier.

"Abstract Sprinting in curvilinear trajectories is an important soccer ability, corresponding to ~85% of the actions performed at maximum velocity in a soccer league. We compared the neuromuscular behavior and foot contact-time between outside leg and inside leg during curve sprinting to both sides in soccer players. Nine soccer players (age=23±4.12 years) performed: 3×Sprint linear, 3×Sprint right curve, and 3×Sprint left curve. An ANOVA with repeated measures was used to compare the differences between inside and outside leg, and Cohen’s d was used to calculate the effect-size. Considering the average data, the performance classification (from best to worst) was as follows: 1. Curve “good” side (2.45±0.11 s), 2. Linear (2.47±0.13 s), and 3. Curve “weak” side (2.56±0.17 s). Comparing linear with curve sprinting, inside leg recorded significant differences (“good” and “weak”; effect size=1.20 and 2, respectively); in contrast, for outside leg, there were no significant differences (“good” and “weak”; effect size=0.30 and 0.49, respectively). Electromyography activity showed significant differences (p≤0.05) during curve sprinting between outside (higher in biceps femoris and gluteus medius) and inside leg (higher activity in semitendinosus and adductor). In summary, inside and outside leg play different roles during curved sprints, but inside leg is more affected by the change from straight to curve sprint.",114,"1","Physical Attributes","2024-11-29T20:22:48.892277Z","https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1144-3175","https://openalex.org/W3029971384","Sprint, Soccer Performance, Medius, Athlete Monitoring, Leg muscle",29.815,"Sports Science and Performance Analysis","Curve Sprinting in Soccer: Kinematic and Neuromuscular Analysis","2024-11-29T20:22:48.892318Z"
"Objectives This study aimed to ascertain if there is a defined pattern of injury related to the percentage of attained adult height and classify injuries according to maturity status bands. Design Prospective cohort study. Methods From 1998–2019, 63 elite male soccer players of at least the U12 category from a Spanish LaLiga club’s academy were followed until reaching their final height. Medical staff recorded injuries following the FIFA consensus and measured height 2–3 times per season. The percentage of adult height at which each injury occurred was calculated using the player’s closest height to the injury and his final adult height. Injuries were classified in maturity bands, pre-peak-height-velocity (PHV) <88%, circa-PHV 88%–96%, and post-PHV >96%. Results There were 509 injuries among the 63 players. Growth-related injuries occurred at a median (IQR) of 91.2% (86.7%–95.2%) of adult height, predominating in pre-PHV and PHV bands. Muscle injuries predominantly occurred at post-PHV, with 77.78% of those conditions occurring within that time frame and at 98.7% (96%–99.5%) of adult height. Likewise, knee and ankle joint/ligament injuries predominated at post-PHV (87% and 65% of total cases, respectively) occurring at 99.0% (97.9%–99.9%) and 98.4% (89.2%–99.4%) of adult height, respectively.

"The use of observational methodology in the sports context provides coaches and other sports professionals with flexible tools that adapt to their needs. In collective sports, the use of these instruments is common for the technical and tactical analysis of the game. Based on the importance of data quality in these instruments, the purpose was to design, validate, and test the reliability of a mixed observational instrument of field formats and category systems to analyze technical and tactical actions in the offense phase in soccer. The instrument collects information regarding the actions with the ball, moment of the play (start, development, and end), and contextual situation for the offensive team and for the goalkeeper. The instrument design, validation, and reliability calculation were done in four stages: (a) review of the literature, (b) design the first draft of the instrument, (c) experts' qualitative and quantitative review of the instrument, and (d) observer training test (reliability calculation). The content validity was established by 12 experts (Ph.D. in sports science or soccer coach with at least of 10 years of coaching experience). The Delphi methodology was used. Experts did a quantitative (scale 0-10) and qualitative evaluation. Experts were asked about: (a) comprehension of the criteria, categorical cores, degree of openness, and their definitions, (b) pertinence of categorical cores and degree of openness, and (c) whether to include other categorical cores or degree of openness in the observation instrument. The lowest Aiken's V index was 0.91 for the categorical core ""numerical situation with opponent goalkeeper."" The inter- and intra-observer reliability presented good levels of agreement. The lowest Kappa index was 0.96 for the inter-reliability in the categorical core ""defensive pressing lines"" and was 0.98 for the intra-reliability in the categorical core ""ball height (start of ball possession),"" ""distance of the defensive player,"" ""ball height (end of ball possession),"" ""numerical situation,"" and ""defensive pressing lines."" The coefficients of the generalizability analysis showed a high level of accuracy, validity and reliability of the instrument.

"The purpose of the study was to evaluate predicted maturity offset (time before age at PHV) and age at PHV (chronological age [CA] minus maturity offset) in a longitudinal sample of 58 under-13 club level soccer players in central Portugal for whom ages at PHV were estimated with the SITAR model. Two maturity offset prediction equations were applied: the original equation which requires CA sitting height, estimated leg length, height and weight, and a modified equation which requires CA and height. Predicted maturity offset increased, on average, with CA at prediction throughout the age range considered, while variation in predicted maturity offset and ages at PHV within CA groups was considerably reduced compared to variation in observed ages at offset and at PHV. Predicted maturity offset and ages at PHV were consistently later than observed maturity offset and age at PHV among early maturing players, and earlier than observed in late maturing players. Both predicted offset and ages at PHV with the two equations were, on average, later than observed among players maturing on time. Intra-individual variation in predicted ages at PHV with each equation was considerable. The results for soccer players were consistent with similar studies in the general population and two recent longitudinal studies of soccer players. The results question the utility of predicted maturity offset and age at PHV as valid indicators of maturity timing and status.",117,"1","Physical Attributes","2024-11-29T20:25:32.187996Z","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254659","https://openalex.org/W3185914177","Soccer Performance, Age groups, Longitudinal study",101.203,"Sports Science and Performance Analysis","Observed and predicted ages at peak height velocity in soccer players","2024-11-29T20:25:32.188032Z"
"To investigate the effects of situational factors (match location, strength of team and opponent) and environmental factors (relative air humidity, temperature and air quality index) on the technical and physical match performance of Chinese Soccer Super League teams (CSL). The generalized mixed modelling was employed to determine the effects by using the data of all 240 matches in the season 2015 collected by Amisco Pro®. Increase in the rank difference would increase the number of goal-scoring related, passing and organizing related actions to a small-to-moderate extent (Effect size [ES]: 0.37–0.99). Match location had small positive effects on goal-scoring related, passing and organizing related variables (ES: 0.27–0.51), while a small negative effect on yellow card (ES = −0.35). Increment in relative air humidity and air quality index would only bring trivial or small effects on all the technical performance (ES: −0.06–0.23). Increase in humidity would decrease the physical performance at a small magnitude (ES: −0.55–−0.38). Teams achieved the highest number in the physical performance-related parameters at the temperature between 11.6 and 15.1 °C.

"Insufficient sleep duration and quality has negative effects on athletic performance, injury susceptibility and athlete development. This study aimed to assess the sleep characteristics of professional Qatar Stars League (QSL) soccer players.In a cross-sectional study, QSL players (n=111; 23.7±4.8 years) completed three questionnaires to screen sleep disorders: (1) Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), (2) Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and (3) Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Poor sleep quality was defined as PSQI≥5, excessive daytime sleepiness was defined by ESS>8 and insomnia was defined as ISI≥11.The prevalence of poor sleep quality (PSQI≥5) was 68.5%, with subthreshold insomnia (ISI≥11) 27.0% and daytime sleepiness 22.5% (ESS>8). Sleep quality was positively associated with insomnia (r=0.42, p<0.001) and daytime sleepiness (r=0.23, p=0.018). Age, anthropometry, body composition and ethnicity were not associated with any of the reported sleep quality parameters.The prevalence of poor sleep quality (68.5%) reported should concern practitioners.

"Abstract The purpose of this investigation was to quantify the association between 5 vs. 5 small sided games (SSG) running performance and physiological performance during the Yo-YoIR1 test to ascertain the utility of SSGs as a potential fitness test modality within elite professional soccer players. Twenty-three (n = 23) elite male professional soccer players (mean ± SD age 25.3 ± 3.1 yrs, mass: 76 ± 9 kg, height: 176 ± 9 cm) were assessed. Players completed an intermittent aerobic fitness test (Yo-YoIR1) and a 5 vs. 5 SSGs protocol for the purpose of the study. During all SSGs players wore GPS (Statsports 10-Hz, Viper Pod, Newry, Northern Ireland) and HR monitors (Polar, Oy Kemple, Finland) with these measures related to Yo-YoIR1 running performance. Results revealed SSGs running performance (TD; m) and physiological performance (HR) showed the lowest CV% (&lt; 5%), with high speed movements, accelerations and decelerations highlighting higher CV% during SSGs. Possibly small to possibly very large associations were observed for running performance during 5 vs. 5 SSGs and Yo-YoIR1 performance, with negative associations observed between physiological performance during SSG and YoYoIR1 running performance. To conclude, the current study observed how running performance during a standardised 5 vs. 5 SSG protocol within elite soccer cohorts is associated with the Yo-YoIR1 running performance. Given the low CV%, repeatability and large association of global running performance and internal load measures during a 5 vs. 5 SSG with Yo-YoIR1 performance, this particular soccer specific SSG protocol potentially supplements traditional non-sport specific testing assessments.",120,"1","Physical Attributes","2024-11-29T20:28:13.014391Z","https://doi.org/10.2478/hukin-2019-0086","https://openalex.org/W3005952218","Soccer Performance, Training Load, Athlete Monitoring, Exercise Training, Performance Analysis, Match play, Sprint, Aerobic exercise",25.395,"Sports Science and Performance Analysis","The Use of Small-Sided Games as an Aerobic Fitness Assessment Supplement within Elite Level Professional Soccer","2024-11-29T20:28:13.014426Z"

"The age of peak performance is likely to vary between sports and competitions, affected by the specific skills and attributes needed to succeed in the particular competition. However, no studies using modern tracking techniques have examined the effects of age on competitive match play performance. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of age on match physical and technical performance using a large-scale analysis of match performance in professional soccer players. A total of 14 546 individual match observations were undertaken in the first German league (Bundesliga) during the 2012-2013, 2013-2014, and 2014-2015 seasons using a computerized tracking system (VISTRACK, by Impire Corp.). Differences in physical and technical match performance of soccer players were analyzed for the following variables: total distance covered, number of fast runs, number of sprints, and percentage of successful passes. Professional soccer players aged >30 years showed a significant lower performance in the total distance covered, the number of fast runs, and the number of sprints compared with younger players (≤30 years). Conversely, the player's ability to make successful passes increased with age. These effects were observed in all positional roles except wide midfielders. These findings may help coaches and managers to better understand the effects of age on match-related physical and technical performance and may have the potential to assist in decisions such as, when a new contract would be signed, the duration of the contract, the salary, or when to replace or transfer a player depending on their age.",122,"1","Physical Attributes","2024-11-29T20:30:26.480797Z","https://doi.org/10.1111/sms.13463","https://openalex.org/W2945797116","Salary, Sport Psychology, Soccer Performance, Match play, Coaching Effectiveness, Athlete Monitoring, Performance Analysis",54.189,"Sports Science and Performance Analysis","Age‐related physical and technical match performance changes in elite soccer players","2024-11-29T20:30:26.480834Z"

"To closely describe the injury inciting events of acute hamstring injuries in professional male football (soccer) using systematic video analysis.Video footage from four seasons (2014-2019) of the two highest divisions in German male football was searched for moderate and severe (ie, time loss of >7 days) acute non-contact and indirect contact match hamstring injuries. Two raters independently categorised inciting events using a standardised procedure to determine specific injury patterns and kinematics.52 cases of hamstring injuries were included for specific pattern analysis. The pattern analysis revealed 25 sprint-related (48%) and 27 stretch-related hamstring injuries (52%). All sprint-related hamstring injuries occured during linear acceleration or high-speed running. Stretch-related hamstring injuries were connected with closed chain movements like braking or stopping with a lunging or landing action and open chain movements like kicking. The kinematic analysis of stretch-related injuries revealed a change of movement involving knee flexion to knee extension and a knee angle of <45° at the assumed injury frame in all open and closed chain movements. Biceps femoris was the most affected muscle (79%) of all included cases.Despite the variety of inciting events, rapid movements with high eccentric demands of the posterior thigh are likely the main hamstring injury mechanism.

"(1) Background: Limited information exists on the prevalence of low energy availability (LEA) in collegiate team sports. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of LEA in collegiate women soccer players. (2) Methods: Collegiate women soccer athletes (n = 18, height: 1.67 ± 0.05 m; body mass: 65.3 ± 7.9 kg; body fat %: 24.9 ± 5.6%) had their body composition and sport nutrition knowledge assessed in the pre-season. Energy availability was assessed mid-season using a 4-day dietary log and activity energy expenditure values from a team-based monitoring system. A validated screening tool was used to screen for LEA. (3) Results: The screening tool classified 56.3% of athletes as at risk of LEA (&lt;30 kcal/kg of FFM); however, the actual dietary intake identified 67% as LEA. Athletes identified as non-LEA consumed significantly more absolute (p = 0.040) and relative (p = 0.004) energy than LEA athletes. (4) Conclusions: There was a high prevalence of LEA among collegiate women soccer athletes.

Comparison of internal and external training loads in male and female collegiate soccer players during practices vs. games. J Strength Cond Res 34(4): 969–974, 2020—The purpose of this study was to compare the internal and external training loads (TLs) in men and women throughout a Division I soccer season during practices versus games. Players were evaluated during all practices and regulation game play using the Polar TeamPro system, utilizing Global Positioning Satellite technology and heart rate (HR) monitoring to determine TL, time spent in HR zones expressed as a percent of HRmax (HR Z1–Z5 ), calories expended per kilogram body mass (Kcal·kg −1 ), distance covered (DIS), sprints, average speed (SPD AVG ), and distance covered in speed zones (DIS Z1–Z5 ). During games, no significant differences were seen between men and women for TL, Kcal·kg −1 , HR Z1–Z5 , SPD AVG , DIS, DIS Z1 , DIS Z3 , and DIS Z4 . However, men accumulated a significantly greater number of sprints and DIS Z5 ( p &lt; 0.05) during games, whereas women accumulated a greater DIS Z2 ( p &lt; 0.05). During practice, no differences were observed for TL, DIS, sprints, Kcal·kg −1 , DIS Z2 , DIS Z3 , HR Z1–Z5 , but men exhibited higher SPD AVG , ( p &lt; 0.05), DIS Z1 ( p &lt; 0.05), DIS Z4 ( p &lt; 0.05), and DIS Z5 ( p &lt; 0.05). The parallels in Kcal·kg −1 , total DIS, HR, and TL indicate a similar relative workload between men and women. However, distance covered in higher speed zones was found to be greater in men than women across practice and games likely reflecting inherent sex differences in the ability to achieve those speeds.

"Abstract This study aimed to assess energy availability (EA), alongside possible risk factors of reduced or low EA of professional female soccer players during a competitive season. Thirteen players (age: 23.7 ± 3.4 y, stature: 1.69 ± 0.08 m, body mass: 63.7 ± 7.0 kg) engaged in a 5‐day (two rest days, one light training, heavy training and match day) monitoring period. Energy intake (EI) and expenditure during exercise (EEE) were measured. EA was calculated and categorised as optimal, reduced or low (&gt;45, 30‐45, &lt;30 kcal·kg FFM −1 ·day −1 , respectively). Relationships between EA and bone mineral density, resting metabolic rate (RMR), plasma micronutrient status, biochemical markers and survey data were assessed. EA was optimal for 15%, reduced for 62% and low for 23% of players. Higher EA was observed on rest days compared to others ( P &lt;0.05). EA was higher for the light compared to the heavy training day ( P &lt;0.001). EEE differed significantly between days ( P &lt;0.05). EI (2124 ± 444 kcal), carbohydrate (3.31 ± 0.64 g·kg·day −1 ) and protein (1.83 ± 0.41 g·kg·day −1 ) intake remained similar ( P &gt;0.05). Survey data revealed 23% scored 8 on the Low Energy Availability in Females Questionnaire and met criteria for low RMR (ratio &lt;0.90). Relationships between EA and risk factors were inconclusive.

"Football (soccer) players might be at increased risk of neurodegenerative disease, which has led to questions regarding the safety of the sport and recent measures introduced by football associations to reduce heading of the ball. We aimed to assess the risk of neurodegenerative disease among male football players in the Swedish top division Allsvenskan, compared with matched controls.In this cohort study, we identified all male football players (amateurs and professionals) who had played at least one game in Allsvenskan from Aug 1, 1924 to Dec 31, 2019 and excluded players whose personal identity number could not be retrieved or be identified in the Total Population Register, and those who were not born in Sweden and who had immigrated to the country after age 15 years. Football players were matched with up to ten controls from the general population according to sex, age, and region of residence. We used nationwide registers to compare the risk of neurodegenerative disease (diagnoses recorded in death certificates, during hospital admissions and outpatient visits, or use of prescription drugs for dementia) among football players versus controls. We also assessed each type of neurodegenerative disease (Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, motor neuron disease, and Parkinson's disease) separately, and compared the risk of neurodegenerative disease among outfield players versus goalkeepers.Of 7386 football players who had played at least one game in the top Swedish division between Aug 1, 1924, and Dec 31, 2019, 182 players were excluded for an unretrievable personal identity number, and 417 were excluded due to their number not being identified in the Total Population Register. After a further exclusion of 780 players and 11 627 controls who were born outside of Sweden and who had immigrated to the country after age 15 years, 6007 football players (510 goalkeepers) were included in the study population along with 56 168 matched controls. During follow-up to Dec 31, 2020, 537 (8·9%) of 6007 football players and 3485 (6·2%) of 56 168 controls were diagnosed with neurodegenerative disease. The risk of neurodegenerative disease was higher among football players than controls (hazard ratio [HR] 1·46 [95% CI 1·33-1·60]). Alzheimer's disease and other dementias were more common among football players than controls (HR 1·62 [95% CI 1·47-1·78]), significant group differences were not observed for motor neuron disease (HR 1·27 [0·73-2·22]), and Parkinson's disease was less common among football players (HR 0·68 [0·52-0·89]). The risk of neurodegenerative disease was higher for outfield players than controls (HR 1·50 [95% CI 1·36-1·65]) but not for goalkeepers versus controls (HR 1·07 [0·78-1·47]), and outfield players had a higher risk of neurodegenerative disease than did goalkeepers (HR 1·43 [1·03-1·99]). All-cause mortality was slightly lower among football players than controls (HR 0·95 [95% CI 0·91-0·99]).In this cohort study, male football players who had played in the Swedish top division had a significantly increased risk of neurodegenerative disease compared with population controls. The risk increase was observed for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias but not for other types of neurodegenerative disease, and among outfield players, but not among goalkeepers.

"Cutting manoeuvres are important actions associated with soccer performance and a key action associated with non-contact anterior cruciate ligament injury; thus, training interventions that can improve cutting performance and movement quality are of great interest. The aim of this study, therefore, was to determine the effects of a six-week change of dire[ction (COD) speed and technique modification training intervention on cutting performance and movement quality in male youth soccer players (U17s, n = 8) in comparison to a control group (CG) (U18s, n = 11) who continued 'normal' training. Cutting performance was assessed based on completion time and COD deficit, and the field-based cutting movement assessment score (CMAS) qualitative screening tool was used to assess cutting movement quality. Significant main effects for time (pre-to-post changes) (p ≤ 0.041, η2 = 0.224-0.839) and significant interaction effects of time and group were observed for cutting completion times, COD deficits, and CMASs. Improvements in completion time (p < 0.001, g = 1.63-1.90, -9% to -11% vs. -5% to 6%) and COD deficit (p ≤ 0.012, g = -1.63 to -2.43, -40-52% vs. -22% to -28%) for the COD intervention group (IG) were approximately two-times greater than the CG. Furthermore, lower CMASs (i.e., improved cutting movement quality) were only observed in the IG (p ≤ 0.025, g = -0.85 to -1.46, -23% to -34% vs. 6-19%) compared to the CG. The positive changes in CMASs were attributed to improved cutting technique and reduced incidences of high-risk deficits such as lateral trunk flexion, extended knee postures, knee valgus, hip internal rotation, and improved braking strategies. The results of this study indicate that COD speed and technique modification training, in addition to normal skills and strength training, improves cutting performance and movement quality in male youth soccer players. Practitioners working with male youth soccer players should implement COD speed and technique modification training to improve cutting performance and movement quality, which may decrease potential injury-risk.",130,"1","Physical Attributes","2024-11-29T20:36:28.967950Z","https://doi.org/10.3390/sports7090205","https://openalex.org/W2971834752","Soccer Performance, Training Load, Performance Analysis, Athletic Training, Muscle Adaptations",9.855,"Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries in Athletes","The Effects of Six-Weeks Change of Direction Speed and Technique Modification Training on Cutting Performance and Movement Quality in Male Youth Soccer Players","2024-11-29T20:36:28.967989Z"
"The influence on the psychological well-being of the players and their sports performance seems to be one of the keys to the current sports practice. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a psychological intervention program for stress control in youth soccer players. A total sample of 19 male youth soccer players (age: 16.3 ± 0.99 years; years playing soccer: 10.89 ± 1.56 years) completed the current research. The Psychological Characteristics Questionnaire related to Sports Performance (CPRD) was used to assess stress factors related to sports competition. A program based on Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy was implemented during eight sessions of approximately 50 min each. A pre-post design was used and statistical differences between pre- and post-measures were checked through dependent sample t-tests. The results indicated that the post-test scores were higher than the pre-tests in ""Influence of the Evaluation of Performance"" and ""Mental Skills"" factors, which supposes a significant improvement of the stress management related to performance evaluation, as well as the use of psychological resources and techniques. In addition, the post-test scores were also higher in the ""Stress Control"" factor, although in this case the differences were not statistically significant.

"The aims of the present study were to provide an in-depth comparison of inter-limb asymmetry and determine how consistently asymmetry favours the same limb during different vertical jump tests. Eighteen elite female under-17 soccer players conducted unilateral squat jumps (SJ), countermovement jumps (CMJ) and drop jumps (DJ) on a portable force platform, with jump height, peak force, concentric impulse and peak power as common metrics across tests. For the magnitude of asymmetry, concentric impulse was significantly greater during the SJ test compared to CMJ (p = 0.019) and DJ (p = 0.003). No other significant differences in magnitude were present. For the direction of asymmetry, Kappa coefficients revealed fair to substantial levels of agreement between the SJ and CMJ (Kappa = 0.35 to 0.61) tests, but only slight to fair levels of agreement between the SJ and DJ (Kappa = -0.26 to 0.18) and CMJ and DJ (Kappa = -0.13 to 0.26) tests. These results highlight that the mean asymmetry value may be a poor indicator of true variability of between-limb differences in healthy athletes.

"Context Data from the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Injury Surveillance Program (ISP) have indicated that ankle injuries are the most common injuries among NCAA soccer players. Objective To review 10 years of NCAA-ISP data for soccer players' ankle injuries to understand how the time period (2004–2005 through 2008–2009 versus 2009–2010 through 2013–2014), anatomical structure injured, and sex of the athlete affected the injury rate, mechanism, and prognosis. Design Descriptive epidemiology study. Setting Online injury surveillance. Main Outcome Measure(s) The NCAA-ISP was queried for men's and women's soccer ankle data from 2004 to 2014. Ankle-injury rates were calculated on the basis of injuries per 1000 athlete-exposures. Rate ratios (RRs) were used to compare injury rates. Injury proportion ratios (IPRs) were used to compare injury characteristics. Results When compared with the 2004–2005 through 2008–2009 seasons, the 2009–2010 through 2013–2014 seasons showed a similar rate of injuries (RR = 0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.85, 1.04) but fewer days missed (P &amp;lt; .001) and fewer recurrent injuries (IPR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.41, 0.74). The 4 most common ankle injuries, which accounted for 95% of ankle injuries, were lateral ligament complex tears (65.67%), tibiofibular ligament (high ankle) sprains (10.3%), contusions (10.1%), and medial (deltoid) ligament tears (9.77%). Of these injuries, high ankle sprains were most likely to cause athletes to miss ≥30 days (IPR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.24, 2.90). Men and women had similar injury rates (RR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.94, 1.11). Men had more contact injuries (IPR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.16, 1.41) and contusion injuries (IPR = 1.34, CI = 1.03, 1.73) but fewer noncontact injuries (IPR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.78, 0.95) and lateral ligamentous complex injuries (IPR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.86, 0.98). Conclusions Although the rate of ankle injuries did not change between the 2004–2005 through 2008–2009 seasons and the 2009–2010 through 2013–2014 seasons, the prognoses improved. Among the 4 most common ankle injuries, high ankle sprains resulted in the worst prognosis.

"Current soccer scientific literature is scarce with regard to examining the technical performance of substitute players. Purpose: This study aimed to analyze the physical and technical performance of substitute players versus those who completed the entire match or were replaced and also examine the performance of substitutes across different playing positions. Method: The sample was composed of 6,631 match observations from 431 professional soccer players competing in the German Bundesliga during the season 2018–2019. These observations were divided into three groups: entire match (n = 3,807), replaced (n = 1,412), and substitutes (n = 1,412). Linear mixed models were adjusted to compare the performance of the three groups independently of playing position and separately for each position (central defenders, fullbacks, central midfielders, wide midfielders, and attackers). Results: Substitute players showed higher total distance covered (effect sizes [ES]: 0.99–1.06), number of sprints (ES: 0.60–0.64), and number of fast runs (ES: 0.83–0.91) relative to playing time than replaced and entire match players. The differences in technical performance between groups varied according to playing position. Substitute central defenders showed less possession (ES: 0.39–0.41), touches (ES: 0.47–0.57), and passes (ES: 0.54–0.59) but higher defensive performance (ES: 0.51–0.54) than replaced and entire match players. Substitutes in midfield and attack positions displayed more possession (ES: 0.22–0.47), touches (ES: 0.27–0.37), and shots (ES: 0.22–0.28) than replaced and entire match players.

The purpose of the study was to quantify the match demands of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III soccer and assess position differences in movement kinematics, heart rate (HR), and energy expenditure. Twenty-five Division III women soccer players (height: 1.61 ± 0.3 m; body mass: 66.7 ± 7.5 kg; fat-free mass: 50.3 ± 6.5 kg; body fat%: 25.6 ± 5.1%) were equipped with a wearable global positioning system to assess the demands of 22 matches throughout a season. Players were categorized by position (goal keepers (GK), center defenders (CB), flank players (FP), forwards (F), and center midfielders (CM)). Players covered 9807 ± 2588 m and 1019 ± 552 m at high speeds (&gt;249.6 m·m−1), with an overall average speed of 62.85 ± 14.7 m·m−1. This resulted in a mean HR of 74.2 ± 6% HR max and energy expenditure of 1259 ± 309 kcal. Significant and meaningful differences in movement kinematics were observed across position groups.

"Recently, concerns regarding sport‐related concussions have increased within the research literature, the media, and popular culture. One potential source of soccer‐related concussions involves the purposeful striking of the ball with one's head (i.e., heading). There is currently limited research on an effective teaching method to improve safe heading technique. In the current study, Behavior Skills Training (BST) was evaluated as a method to teach correct heading techniques to youth soccer players. BST increased the percentage of correct steps for each player based on a task analysis of heading. Based on social validity questionnaires administered to players and the coach, BST was rated as an acceptable form of training. After the final training session, experienced coaches rated each player as having improved from baseline to training.",137,"1","Medical / Injuries","2024-11-29T20:44:33.136643Z","https://doi.org/10.1002/jaba.557","https://openalex.org/W2931304534","Sports-related, Multiple baseline design",14.276,"Epidemiology and Impact of Traumatic Brain Injury","Reducing risk of head injury in youth soccer: An extension of behavioral skills training for heading","2024-11-29T20:44:33.136676Z"
"Purpose : To compare between-tests changes in submaximal exercise heart rate (HR ex , 3 min, 12 km/h) and the speed associated with 4 mmol/L of blood lactate (V4mmol) in soccer players to get insight into their level of agreement and respective sensitivity to changes in players’ fitness. Methods : A total of 19 elite professional players (23 [3] y) performed 2 to 3 graded incremental treadmill tests (3-min stages interspersed with 1 min of passive recovery, starting speed 8 km/h, increment 2 km/h until exhaustion or 18 km/h if exhaustion was not reached before) over 1.5 seasons. The correlation between the changes in HR ex and V4mmol was examined. Individual changes in the 2 variables were compared (&gt;2 × typical error considered “clear”). Results : The changes in HR ex and V4mmol were largely correlated ( r = .82; 90% confidence interval, .65–.91). In more than 90% of the cases, when a clear individual change in HR ex was observed, it was associated with a similar clear change in V4mmol (the same direction, improvement, or impairment of fitness) and conversely. Conclusions : When it comes to testing players submaximally, the present results suggest that practitioners can use HR ex or V4mmol interchangeably with confidence. However, in comparison with a field-based standardized warm-up run (3–4 min, all players together), the value of a multistage incremental test with repeated blood lactate samplings is questionable for a monitoring purpose given its time, labor, cost, and poorer player buy-in.",138,"1","Physical Attributes","2024-11-29T20:45:04.136325Z","https://doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2019-0911","https://openalex.org/W3090703574","Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing, Soccer Performance, Training Load, Exercise Capacity, Athlete Monitoring, Treadmill",28.432,"Sports Science and Performance Analysis","Monitoring Cardiorespiratory Fitness in Professional Soccer Players: Is It Worth the Prick?","2024-11-29T20:45:04.136361Z"
"We examine how mental fatigue (MF) influences peripheral perception, tactical behaviour, and physical performance of soccer players during a standardized small-sided game.Eighteen male university first-team soccer players participated. A modified Stroop task and the Vienna Test System were employed to induce MF and to evaluate players' peripheral perception, respectively. The FUT-SAT test was used to assess participants' tactical behaviour and physical performance was quantified using GPS technology.MF decreased players' visual field (pre-test = 189.9° and post-test = 181.6°). Additionally, MF constrained players to more frequently perform actions related to the tactical principles of penetration, depth mobility, and defensive unity, and less frequently perform actions of defensive coverage and balance. During MF, players showed decreased accuracy in actions related to the principles of offensive coverage, width and length, offensive unity, delay, balance, concentration, and defensive unity. Finally, under MF players covered higher total distance and at more moderate speed.MF decreased players' peripheral perception, making them prioritize actions towards the opposing goal and protecting their own goal, while displaying more errors for most tactical actions. In summary, MF impaired several aspects of players' cognitive and tactical behaviours, causing a compensatory increase in physical performance.",139,"1","Psychology","2024-11-29T20:45:37.949329Z","https://doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2020.1756681","https://openalex.org/W3021478927","Stroop effect, Offensive, Sport Psychology, Soccer Performance, Coaching Effectiveness, Affect (linguistics), Training Load, Exercise Motivation",8.602,"Sports Science and Performance Analysis","How does mental fatigue affect soccer performance during small-sided games?

"Strength training is crucial for soccer players' long-term development at early ages and the biological maturation may influence specific strength-training adaptations. The aim of this study was to propose a strength-training programme for the strength development of pre-pubertal players and to analyse the adaptations to this training programme in players with different maturity status. One hundred and thirty young male soccer players participated in an 8-week strength-training programme consisting of two sessions per week (20-minutes of a combination of plyometric and resistance exercises) which was conducted prior to their normal soccer training. Three maturity groups were defined according to the years from/to their peak height velocity (PHV) as Pre-, Mid- and Post-PHV. Initial differences between the maturity groups were found in anthropometrical (weight and height) and physical performance variables (One Repetition Maximum (RM), Peak Power output (PP), 30-m sprint and T-test). The strength-training programme was beneficial for the three maturity groups (p< 0.05) with general greater improvements for the Pre- and Mid-PHV groups, with large effects in RM, PP and T-test, than for the Post-PHV group (moderate effects). The strength-training programme proposed in the present study seems to be positive for the strength-related development in young soccer players especially for Pre- and Mid-PHV players.

The participants were youth football players (n = 59; age: 13.40 ± 1.25 years) divided according to their age into U13 (11–12 years of age; n = 29), and U15 (13–14 years of age; n = 30) categories. Additionally, performance levels (starters [first-team] vs. non-starters [substitutes]) were observed in each age category. The dependent variables were newly developed FS_RAG and FS_CODS tests. The independent variables were sprinting capacities over 10 and 20 meters (S10M, S20M), countermovement jump (CMJ), the reactive strength index (RSI), and a generic CODS test of 20 yards (20Y). The newly developed FS_CODS and FS_RAG were observed as dependent variables. Results showed appropriate intra-testing and inter-testing reliability of the FS_RAG and FS_CODS, with somewhat better reliability of the FS_CODS (ICC=0.82 and 0.79, respectively). Additionally, better reliability was evidenced in U15 than in U13 (ICC: 0.82–0.85, and 0.78-0.80 for U15 and U13, respectively). Independent samples t-test indicated significant differences between U13 and U15 in S10 (t-test: 3.57, p &lt; 0.001), S20M (t-test: 3.13, p &lt; 0.001), 20Y (t-test: 4.89, p &lt; 0.001), FS_RAG (t-test: 3.96, p &lt; 0.001), and FS_CODS (t-test: 6.42, p &lt; 0.001), with better performance in U15. Starters outperformed non-starters in most capacities among U13, but only in FS_RAG among U15 (t-test: 1.56, p &lt; 0.05). Multiple regression calculations indicated nonsignificant association between independent and dependent variables in U13 (FS_CODS: 19%, FS_RAG: 21% of the explained variance, both p &gt; 0.05), but independent variables explained significant proportion of both dependent variables in U15 (FS_CODS: 35%, FS_RAG: 33% explained variance, both p &lt; 0.05). The study confirmed the applicability of newly developed tests in distinguishing studied age categories of players. Results indicate that superiority in all studied fitness capacities is translated into performance level in U13. Meanwhile, FS_RAG seems to be important determinant of quality in U15.",145,"1","Physical Attributes","2024-11-29T20:48:41.596487Z","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17010294","https://openalex.org/W2998681528","Football players, Soccer Performance, Youth Athletes",16.332,"Sports Science and Performance Analysis","Agility Testing in Youth Football (Soccer)Players; Evaluating Reliability, Validity, and Correlates of Newly Developed Testing Protocols","2024-11-29T20:48:41.596525Z"
"The aim of this study was to test associations between accumulated external load and changes in body composition, isokinetic strength, and aerobic capacity of soccer players. Twenty-three professional soccer players (age: 24.7±2.8 years; height: 179.2±6.3; experience: 9.7±2.1 years) participated in this study. This pre-post study design was performed during 10 weeks from July to August of 2017 (4 weeks of pre-season and 6 weeks during the early season). Players were monitored daily by GPS technology and were assessed before and after a 10-week period in terms of body mass (BM), fat mass (FM), lean mass (LM), isokinetic strength at 60º/s, VO2max, and HRmax. Large-to-very large positive correlations were found between the sum of sprinting distance and % differences of BM (0.70, [-0.09;0.95]), HRmax (0.51, [-0.37;0.91]), agonist (quadriceps)/antagonist (hamstrings) left ratio (0.84, [0.27;0.97]) and agonist/antagonist right ratio (0.92, [0.58;0.99]). Large positive correlations were found between the acceleration sum and % differences of VO2max (0.58, [-0.29;0.92]), quadriceps left peak torque (0.66, [-0.16;0.94]), hamstrings left peak torque (0.68, [-0.13;0.94]) and hamstrings right peak torque (0.62, [-0.22;0.93]). Sprinting load was largely and positively associated with changes in knee strength asymmetries. Acceleration sum was largely and positively correlated with variations at VO2max and peak torques at hamstrings. In addition, dose-response relationships using external load variables were identified in professional soccer players.",146,"1","Physical Attributes","2024-11-29T20:49:18.619454Z","https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.00443","https://openalex.org/W2938704661","Training Load, Exercise Capacity, Muscle Adaptations, Athlete Monitoring, Soccer Performance",16.598,"Sports Science and Performance Analysis","Dose-Response Relationship Between External Load Variables, Body Composition, and Fitness Variables in Professional Soccer Players","2024-11-29T20:49:18.619490Z"
"To optimize use of available resources, professional academies develop strategies to assess, monitor, and evaluate players as they progress through adolescence toward adulthood. However, few published reports exist using longitudinal study designs to examine performance throughout adolescence and the transition from youth to professional soccer. We examined differences in the age of player recruitment alongside longitudinal performance differences on field‐based fitness tests of successful vs. unsuccessful graduates across the entire age spectrum recruited by a professional soccer academy. Altogether, 537 youth soccer players volunteered to participate. We recorded the age of recruitment, biannual fitness test performance, and subsequent success in attaining a senior professional contract at the club across a period of 12 years. Only 53 (10%) of players were successful in obtaining a professional contract, with 68% of players who became professional being recruited at 12 years of age or older. Individuals recruited at an earlier age did not display a higher probability of success in attaining a professional contract. Bayesian regression models reported a consistent interaction between age and group for data on all performance measures. Moreover, “successful” academy graduates only physically outperformed their “unsuccessful” counterparts from age ~13‐14 years onward, with either no differences in performance, or performance on physical fitness tests favoring “unsuccessful” players prior to this age. Findings suggest that high achievers during childhood and early adolescence may not develop into successful senior professionals, raising concerns about the predictive utility of talent identification models.",147,"1","Scouting / Finance","2024-11-29T20:49:46.690893Z","https://doi.org/10.1111/sms.13701","https://openalex.org/W3034648330","Coaching Effectiveness, Athlete Development, Soccer Performance, Longitudinal study, Youth Sport Specialization, Sport Psychology, Attendance",24.584,"Sports Science and Performance Analysis","Progression from youth to professional soccer: A longitudinal study of successful and unsuccessful academy graduates","2024-11-29T20:49:46.690932Z"
"Toward the goal of automatic production for sports broadcasts, a paramount task consists in understanding the high-level semantic information of the game in play.For instance, recognizing and localizing the main actions of the game would allow producers to adapt and automatize the broadcast production, focusing on the important details of the game and maximizing the spectator engagement.In this paper, we focus our analysis on action spotting in soccer broadcast, which consists in temporally localizing the main actions in a soccer game.To that end, we propose a novel feature pooling method based on NetVLAD, dubbed NetVLAD++, that embeds temporally-aware knowledge.Different from previous pooling methods that consider the temporal context as a single set to pool from, we split the context before and after an action occurs.We argue that considering the contextual information around the action spot as a single entity leads to a sub-optimal learning for the pooling module.With NetVLAD++, we disentangle the context from the past and future frames and learn specific vocabularies of semantics for each subsets, avoiding to blend and blur such vocabulary in time.Injecting such prior knowledge creates more informative pooling modules and more discriminative pooled features, leading into a better understanding of the actions.We train and evaluate our methodology on the recent large-scale dataset SoccerNet-v2, reaching 53.4% Average-mAP for action spotting, a +12.7% improvement w.r.",148,"1","Innovative Technologies","2024-11-29T20:50:04.380324Z","https://doi.org/10.1109/cvprw53098.2021.00506","https://openalex.org/W3190286596","Pooling, Spotting, Discriminative model, Action Recognition, Event Detection, Video Summarization, Novelty Detection, Soccer Video, Feature (linguistics)",13.758,"Human Action Recognition and Pose Estimation","Temporally-Aware Feature Pooling for Action Spotting in Soccer Broadcasts","2024-11-29T20:50:04.380385Z"
"ABSTRACT This review provides a definition for multidirectional speed (MDS) and evaluates its technical and mechanical underpinnings. This review explores each component of MDS while considering unique aspects of youth physiology and epidemiology. With a theoretical understanding of MDS, practitioners will be more informed on the planning and periodization of MDS training methods in soccer. MDS comprises linear speed, change of direction speed, curvilinear speed, contextual speed, and agility, which each have distinct physiological, biomechanical, and neurocognitive distinctions that can either be differentiated or harmonized to optimize training.",149,"1","Physical Attributes","2024-11-29T20:50:17.259081Z","https://doi.org/10.1519/ssc.0000000000000658","https://openalex.org/W3174787077","Periodization, Neurocognitive, Sport Psychology, Youth Sport Specialization, Component (thermodynamics)",10.165,"Sports Science and Performance Analysis","Multidirectional Speed in Youth Soccer Players: Theoretical Underpinnings","2024-11-29T20:50:17.259138Z"
"The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of chronological age (CA) and somatic maturation on body composition (BC) and bioimpedance parameters in male elite soccer players. BC and bioimpedance variables were measured in a sample of 249 players aged 9−18 years of age and registered in two professional Italian soccer teams. Results from segmental analysis showed transition time points where the influence of CA and somatic maturation on bioimpedance patterns and BC characteristics increased or subsided. The accelerated phases were assessed for fat free mass, total body water, and upper muscle area, with a starting time point at approximately −2.00 years from peak at velocity (YPHV), and for body cell mass, whose developmental tempo sped up around −1.00 YPHV. An increase in the rate of development was also observed close to −2.00 YPHV for phase angle (PA), although without accelerated phases. From a CA point of view, significant slope changes were found for all BC and bioimpendance variables, except for the calf muscle area. Although the starting points and the span of the accelerated phases were different, they subsided or disappeared at ~ 15 years, except for PA, whose growth waned at ~ 17 years.",150,"1","Physical Attributes","2024-11-29T20:53:05.939381Z","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16234711","https://openalex.org/W2990928670","Soccer Performance, Elite, Segmental Body Composition",143.825,"Body Composition Assessment and Analysis","The Role of Somatic Maturation on Bioimpedance Patterns and Body Composition in Male Elite Youth Soccer Players","2024-11-29T20:53:05.939429Z"
