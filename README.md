# The Impact of Research Categories on Collaboration and Citation Patterns in Soccer Studies

This repository contains the code and data for the study titled *The Impact of Research Categories on Collaboration and Citation Patterns in Soccer Studies*. The study explores thematic categories in soccer-related research, focusing on collaboration networks and citation patterns. Data was collected via the OpenAlex API and analyzed using machine learning models and bibliometric tools.

## Key Contributions

- **Data Collection**: ~15,000 soccer-related articles (2017â€“2024) retrieved via the OpenAlex API.
- **Thematic Categorization**: Articles classified into eight categories (e.g., *Tactics Analysis*, *Medical/Injuries*, *Scouting/Finance*) using a fine-tuned RoBERTa model.
- **Collaboration Networks**: Co-authorship patterns visualized using VOSviewer, highlighting interdisciplinary collaboration.
- **Citation Analysis**: Random Forest regressions identified the strongest predictors of citation counts.
- **TCC Index**: Introduced the Time-Weighted Collaboration and Citation (TCC) Index to measure the influence of collaboration timing and co-author success.
- **Linear Regression**: Linear Regression (OLS) model was employed to look at predictors of higher citation counts, and to examine the impact of co-author citations, across the categories.
