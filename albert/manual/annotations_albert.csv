"Social contact and reconciliation It has been theorized that positive intergroup relations can reduce prejudice and facilitate peace. However, supporting empirical evidence is weak, particularly in the context of real-world conflict. Mousa randomized Christian Iraqi refugees to soccer teams that were composed of either all Christian players or a mixture of Christian and Muslim players (see the Perspective by Paluck and Clark). Playing on the same team as Muslims had positive effects on Christian players' attitudes and behaviors toward Muslims within the context of soccer, but these effects did not generalize to non-soccer contexts. These findings have implications for the potential benefits and limits of positive intergroup contact for achieving peace between groups.

Abstract Soccer analytics is attracting increasing interest in academia and industry, thanks to the availability of sensing technologies that provide high-fidelity data streams for every match. Unfortunately, these detailed data are owned by specialized companies and hence are rarely publicly available for scientific research. To fill this gap, this paper describes the largest open collection of soccer-logs ever released, containing all the spatio-temporal events (passes, shots, fouls, etc.) that occured during each match for an entire season of seven prominent soccer competitions. Each match event contains information about its position, time, outcome, player and characteristics. The nature of team sports like soccer, halfway between the abstraction of a game and the reality of complex social systems, combined with the unique size and composition of this dataset, provide an ideal ground for tackling a wide range of data science problems, including the measurement and evaluation of performance, both at individual and at collective level, and the determinants of success and failure.;60;1;Innovative Technologies;2024-10-28T19:30:38.813007Z;https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-019-0247-7;https://openalex.org/W2981841290;Abstraction, Spatial Analysis, Sports science;194.521;Economics of Professional Sports and Prediction Markets;A public data set of spatio-temporal match events in soccer competitions;2024-10-28T19:30:38.813028Z
"Talent identification research in soccer comprises the prediction of elite soccer performance. While many studies in this field have aimed to empirically relate performance characteristics to subsequent soccer success, a critical evaluation of the methodology of these studies has mostly been absent in the literature. In this position paper, we discuss advantages and limitations of the design, validity, and utility of current soccer talent identification research. Specifically, we draw on principles from selection psychology that can contribute to best practices in the context of making selection decisions across domains. Based on an extensive search of the soccer literature, we identify four methodological issues from this framework that are relevant for talent identification research, i.e. (1) the operationalization of criterion variables (the performance to be predicted) as performance levels; (2) the focus on isolated performance indicators as predictors of soccer performance; (3) the effects of range restriction on the predictive validity of predictors used in talent identification; and (4) the effect of the base rate on the utility of talent identification procedures. Based on these four issues, we highlight opportunities and challenges for future soccer talent identification studies that may contribute to developing evidence-based selection procedures. We suggest for future research to consider the use of individual soccer criterion measures, to adopt representative, high-fidelity predictors of soccer performance, and to take restriction of range and the base rate into account.";61;1;Other;2024-10-28T19:32:40.096967Z;https://doi.org/10.1007/s40279-019-01113-w;https://openalex.org/W2945185040;Identification (biology), Coaching Effectiveness, Sport Psychology, Soccer Performance;121.172;Economics of Professional Sports and Prediction Markets;Methodological Issues in Soccer Talent Identification Research;2024-10-28T19:32:40.096986Z
Abstract The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of mental fatigue on passing decision‐making in professional soccer athletes. A controlled and counterbalanced cross‐over design was adopted consisting of three visits with a 1‐week interval between sessions. Twenty professional soccer male athletes participated in three randomized conditions divided into three visits: control, 15‐min Stroop task, and 30‐min Stroop task. Inhibitory control was accessed by the Stroop task (accuracy and response time) before and after induced mental fatigue protocol. The athletes played a training match (90‐min) following the experimental conditions. The Game Performance Assessment Instrument (GPAI) was used for the passing decision‐making analysis. The GPAI analysis showed impaired passing decision‐making performance following the 30‐min Stroop task compared with the 15‐min and control condition ( F (2,17) = 6.99, p = .01). Moreover, an increase in response time during the Stroop task was found following 30‐min Stroop task condition ( F (2,17) = 6.57, p = .03) compared to 15‐min of Stroop task and control conditions. Prolonged cognitive tasks may be considered a mediating factor in passing decision‐making performance in male professional soccer athletes throughout a full‐length training match. Thus, athletes should avoid highly demanding‐cognitive tasks before a soccer match. Future studies are required to explore more ecological cognitive tasks to induce mental fatigue (i.e. smartphones and video‐games) and their effects on other performance indicators (e.g. physical, technical, tactical) in a full‐length training match setting.;62;1;Psychology;2024-10-28T19:33:02.369019Z;https://doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2019.1656781;https://openalex.org/W2969965784;Stroop effect, Soccer Performance, Training Load, Performance Analysis, Athlete Monitoring, Exercise Motivation, Mental fatigue, Elementary cognitive task;22.16;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;Effects of mental fatigue on passing decision-making performance in professional soccer athletes;2024-10-28T19:33:02.369041Z
"Abstract Bishop, C, Read, P, McCubbine, J, and Turner, A. Vertical and horizontal asymmetries are related to slower sprinting and jump performance in elite youth female soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 35(1): 56–63, 2021—Interlimb asymmetries have been shown to be greater during vertical jumping compared with horizontal jumping. Notable interlimb differences have also been established at an early age in male youth soccer players. Furthermore, given the multiplanar nature of soccer, establishing between-limb differences from multiple jump tests is warranted. At present, a paucity of data exists regarding asymmetries in youth female soccer players and their effects on physical performance. The aims of this study were to quantify interlimb asymmetries from unilateral jump tests and examine their effects on speed and jump performance. Nineteen elite youth female soccer players performed a single-leg countermovement jump (SLCMJ), single, triple, and crossover hops for distance, and a 20-m sprint test. Test reliability was good to excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.81–0.99) and variability acceptable (coefficient of variation = 1.74–5.42%). A 1-way analysis of variance highlighted larger asymmetries from the SLCMJ compared with all other jump tests ( p &lt; 0.05). Pearson's correlations portrayed significant relationships between vertical asymmetries from the SLCMJ and slower sprint times ( r = 0.49–0.59). Significant negative relationships were also found between horizontal asymmetries during the triple hop test and horizontal jump performance ( r = −0.47 to −0.58) and vertical asymmetries during the SLCMJ and vertical jump performance ( r = −0.47 to −0.53). The results from this study highlight that the SLCMJ seems to be the most appropriate jump test for identifying between-limb differences with values ∼12% showing negative associations with sprint times. Furthermore, larger asymmetries are associated with reduced jump performance and would appear to be direction specific. Practitioners can use this information as normative data to be mindful of when quantifying interlimb asymmetries and assessing their potential impact on physical performance in youth female soccer players.";63;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T19:33:10.424281Z;https://doi.org/10.1519/jsc.0000000000002544;https://openalex.org/W2788635959;Sprint, Vertical jump, Athlete Monitoring, Youth Athletes, Soccer Performance, Athlete Development, Youth Sport Specialization;7.85;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;Vertical and Horizontal Asymmetries Are Related to Slower Sprinting and Jump Performance in Elite Youth Female Soccer Players;2024-10-28T19:33:10.424294Z

"Running performance (RP) and game performance indicators (GPI) are important determinants of success in soccer (football), but there is an evident lack of knowledge about the possible associations between RP and GPI. This study aimed to identify associations between RP and GPI in professional soccer players and to compare RP and GPI among soccer playing positions. One hundred one match performances were observed over the course of half of a season at the highest level of national competition in Croatia. Players (mean ± SD, age: 23.85 ± 2.88 years; body height: 183.05 ± 8.88 cm; body mass: 78.69 ± 7.17 kg) were classified into five playing positions (central defenders (n = 26), full-backs (n = 24), central midfielders (n = 33), wide midfielders (n = 10), and forwards (n = 8). RP, as measured by global positioning system, included the total distance covered, distance covered in five speed categories (walking, jogging, running, high-speed running, and maximal sprinting), total number of accelerations, number of high-intensity accelerations, total number of decelerations, and number of high-intensity decelerations. The GPI were collected by the position-specific performance statistics index (InStat index). The average total distance was 10,298.4 ± 928.7 m, with central defenders having the shortest and central midfielders having the greatest covered distances. The running (r = 0.419, p = 0.03) and high-intensity accelerations (r = 0.493, p = 0.01) were correlated with the InStat index for central defenders. The number of decelerations of full-backs (r = -0.43, p = 0.04) and the distance covered during sprinting of forwards (r = 0.80, p = 0.02) were associated with their GPI obtained by InStat index. The specific correlations between RP and GPI should be considered during the conditioning process in soccer. The soccer training should follow the specific requirements of the playing positions established herein, which will allow players to meet the game demands and to perform successfully.";65;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T19:33:31.750775Z;https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16204032;https://openalex.org/W2980810229;Soccer Performance, Performance Analysis, Sport Psychology, Athlete Monitoring, Football players, Match play;15.916;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;Analysis of the Association between Running Performance and Game Performance Indicators in Professional Soccer Players;2024-10-28T19:33:31.750795Z
Elite soccer teams that participate in European competitions need to have players in the best physical and psychological status possible to play matches. As a consequence of congestive schedule, controlling the training load (TL) and thus the level of effort and fatigue of players to reach higher performances during the matches is therefore critical. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to provide the first report of seasonal internal and external training load that included Hooper Index (HI) scores in elite soccer players during an in-season period. Nineteen elite soccer players were sampled, using global position system to collect total distance, high-speed distance (HSD) and average speed (AvS). It was also collected session rating of perceived exertion (s-RPE) and HI scores during the daily training sessions throughout the 2015–2016 in-season period. Data were analysed across ten mesocycles (M: 1 to 10) and collected according to the number of days prior to a one-match week. Total daily distance covered was higher at the start (M1 and M3) compared to the final mesocycle (M10) of the season. M1 (5589m) reached a greater distance than M5 (4473m) (ES = 9.33 [12.70, 5.95]) and M10 (4545m) (ES = 9.84 [13.39, 6.29]). M3 (5691m) reached a greater distance than M5 (ES = 9.07 [12.36, 5.78]), M7 (ES = 6.13 [8.48, 3.79]) and M10 (ES = 9.37 [12.76, 5.98]). High-speed running distance was greater in M1 (227m), than M5 (92m) (ES = 27.95 [37.68, 18.22]) and M10 (138m) (ES = 8.46 [11.55, 5.37]). Interestingly, the s-RPE response was higher in M1 (331au) in comparison to the last mesocycle (M10, 239au). HI showed minor variations across mesocycles and in days prior to the match. Every day prior to a match, all internal and external TL variables expressed significant lower values to other days prior to a match (p<0.01). In general, there were no differences between player positions. Conclusions: Our results reveal that despite the existence of some significant differences between mesocycles, there were minor changes across the in-season period for the internal and external TL variables used. Furthermore, it was observed that MD-1 presented a reduction of external TL (regardless of mesocycle) while internal TL variables did not have the same record during in-season match-day-minus.;66;1;Psychology;2024-10-28T19:34:14.760659Z;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0209393;https://openalex.org/W2949122094;Training Load, Elite, High-Intensity Interval Training, Athlete Monitoring, Soccer Performance, Perceived exertion, Team sport, Performance Analysis;42.898;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;In-season internal and external training load quantification of an elite European soccer team;2024-10-28T19:34:14.760681Z
The aim of this study was to examine how the introduction of the VAR system influenced the play in elite soccer. The sample consists of 1024 matches played in the Italian Serie A and the German Bundesliga league during the seasons before and after the implementation of the VAR system. The following variables were recorded for each match: Fouls, Goals, Offsides, Penalties, Playing time in the first half, Playing time in the second half, Total Playing time, Red cards and Yellow cards. Match statistics were retrieved from the website of “Whoscored” (www.whoscored.com). A generalized linear model and a pairwise z-tests were used to compare seasons before and after the implementation of the VAR. There was a decrease in the number of offsides, fouls and yellow cards after the implementation of the VAR. Meanwhile, there was an increase in the number of minutes added to the playing time in the first half and the full game, but not in the second half. These findings may help coaches, players and managers to better understand the effects of the VAR system on professional soccer and to identify strategies to improve refereeing during matches.;67;1;Innovative Technologies;2024-10-28T19:34:18.787948Z;https://doi.org/10.1080/24748668.2019.1646521;https://openalex.org/W2964034544;Elite, Referee Bias, Soccer Performance, Sample (material);3.916;Economics of Professional Sports and Prediction Markets;How does Video Assistant Referee (VAR) modify the game in elite soccer?;2024-10-28T19:34:18.787969Z
The COVID-19 pandemic has, among other things, a significant impact on the economic situation of sports in general and professional soccer in particular. Our paper points out the main effects of the crisis on professional soccer. To this end, the general effects of the pandemic on sports will be briefly outlined, followed by a discussion of matches played behind closed doors. Based on the general conditions and particularities of the team sports industry, possible solutions for dealing with any problems arising from the pandemic will be discussed from the perspective of economics. As a result, we prefer intra-industry market-based solutions such as a solidarity fund or measures of self-regulation to possible state subsidies.;68;1;Scouting / Finance;2024-10-28T19:34:37.628854Z;https://doi.org/10.1080/14660970.2020.1802256;https://openalex.org/W3047118747;Pandemic, Economic Impacts, 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak;18.732;Economics of Professional Sports and Prediction Markets;Exploring the sports economic impact of COVID-19 on professional soccer;2024-10-28T19:34:37.628875Z
"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is reported at high prevalence in selected autopsy case series of former contact sports athletes. Nevertheless, the contribution of CTE pathology to clinical presentation and its interaction with co-morbid neurodegenerative pathologies remain unclear. To address these issues, we performed comprehensive neuropathology assessments on the brains of former athletes with dementia and considered these findings together with detailed clinical histories to derive an integrated clinicopathological diagnosis for each case. Consecutive, autopsy-acquired brains from former soccer and rugby players with dementia were assessed for neurodegenerative pathologies using established and preliminary consensus protocols. Thereafter, next of kin interviews were conducted to obtain detailed accounts of the patient’s clinical presentation and course of disease to inform a final, integrated clinicopathological diagnosis. Neuropathologic change consistent with CTE (CTE-NC) was confirmed in five of seven former soccer and three of four former rugby players’ brains, invariably in combination with mixed, often multiple neurodegenerative pathologies. However, in just three cases was the integrated dementia diagnosis consistent with CTE, the remainder having alternate diagnoses, with the most frequent integrated diagnosis Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (four cases; one as mixed AD and vascular dementia). This consecutive autopsy series identifies neuropathologic change consistent with preliminary diagnostic criteria for CTE (CTE-NC) in a high proportion of former soccer and rugby players dying with dementia. However, in the majority, CTE-NC appears as a co-morbidity rather than the primary, dementia causing pathology. As such, we suggest that while CTE-NC might be common in former athletes with dementia, in many cases its clinical significance remains uncertain.";69;1;Medical / Injuries;2024-10-28T19:35:23.276971Z;https://doi.org/10.1007/s00401-019-02030-y;https://openalex.org/W2947253577;Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, Neuropathology, Encephalopathy, Vascular dementia;45.498;Epidemiology and Impact of Traumatic Brain Injury;Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is a common co-morbidity, but less frequent primary dementia in former soccer and rugby players;2024-10-28T19:35:23.276996Z
"Background A few small studies have reported on the mechanisms of ACL injury in professional male football. Aim To describe the mechanisms, situational patterns and biomechanics (kinematics) of ACL injuries in professional male football matches. Methods We identified 148 consecutive ACL injuries across 10 seasons of professional Italian football. 134 (90%) injury videos were analysed for mechanism and situational pattern, while biomechanical analysis was possible in 107 cases. Three independent reviewers evaluated each video. ACL injury epidemiology (month), timing within the match and pitch location at the time of injury were also reported. Results 59 (44%) injuries were non-contact, 59 (44%) were indirect contact and 16 (12%) were direct contact. Players were frequently perturbed immediately prior to injury. We identified four main situational patterns for players who suffered a non-contact or an indirect contact injury: (1) pressing and tackling (n=55); (2) tackled (n=24); (3) regaining balance after kicking (n=19); and (4) landing from a jump (n=8). Knee valgus loading (n=83, 81%) was the dominant injury pattern across all four of these situational patterns (86%, 86%, 67% and 50%, respectively). 62% of the injuries occurred in the first half of the matches (p&lt;0.01). Injuries peaked at the beginning of the season (September–October) and were also higher at the end of the season (March–May). Conclusions 88% of ACL injuries occurred without direct knee contact, but indirect contact injuries were as frequent as non-contact injuries, underlying the importance of mechanical perturbation. The most common situational patterns were pressing, being tackled and kicking.";70;1;Medical / Injuries;2024-10-28T19:35:33.955210Z;https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2019-101247;https://openalex.org/W3036317957;ACL injury, Biomechanical Analysis, Biomechanics, Situational ethics, Injury Risk, Knee Biomechanics, Body contact;10.566;Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries in Athletes;Systematic video analysis of ACL injuries in professional male football (soccer): injury mechanisms, situational patterns and biomechanics study on 134 consecutive cases;2024-10-28T19:35:33.955230Z
Understanding broadcast videos is a challenging task in computer vision, as it requires generic reasoning capabilities to appreciate the content offered by the video editing. In this work, we propose SoccerNet-v2, a novel large-scale corpus of manual annotations for the SoccerNet [24] video dataset, along with open challenges to encourage more research in soccer understanding and broadcast production. Specifically, we release around 300k annotations within SoccerNet’s 500 untrimmed broadcast soccer videos. We extend current tasks in the realm of soccer to include action spotting, camera shot segmentation with boundary detection, and we define a novel replay grounding task. For each task, we provide and discuss benchmark results, reproducible with our open-source adapted implementations of the most relevant works in the field. SoccerNet-v2 is presented to the broader research community to help push computer vision closer to automatic solutions for more general video understanding and production purposes.;71;1;Innovative Technologies;2024-10-28T19:35:42.725540Z;https://doi.org/10.1109/cvprw53098.2021.00508;https://openalex.org/W3186413649;Soccer Video, Video Summarization, Benchmark (surveying), Implementation, Task analysis;8.661;Automatic Video Summarization and Analysis;SoccerNet-v2: A Dataset and Benchmarks for Holistic Understanding of Broadcast Soccer Videos;2024-10-28T19:35:42.725560Z
Hamstring strain injury (HSI) is one of the most prevalent and severe injury in professional soccer. The purpose was to analyze and compare the predictive ability of a range of machine learning techniques to select the best performing injury risk factor model to identify professional soccer players at high risk of HSIs. A total of 96 male professional soccer players underwent a pre-season screening evaluation that included a large number of individual, psychological and neuromuscular measurements. Injury surveillance was prospectively employed to capture all the HSI occurring in the 2013/2014 season. There were 18 HSIs. Injury distribution was 55.6% dominant leg and 44.4% non-dominant leg. The model generated by the SmooteBoostM1 technique with a cost-sensitive ADTree as the base classifier reported the best evaluation criteria (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve score=0.837, true positive rate=77.8%, true negative rate=83.8%) and hence was considered the best for predicting HSI. The prediction model showed moderate to high accuracy for identifying professional soccer players at risk of HSI during pre-season screenings. Therefore, the model developed might help coaches, physical trainers and medical practitioners in the decision-making process for injury prevention.;72;1;Medical / Injuries;2024-10-28T19:42:57.831885Z;https://doi.org/10.1055/a-0826-1955;https://openalex.org/W2916852780;Sports Injury, Hamstring Strain;434.998;Epidemiology of Sports-Related Musculoskeletal Injuries;A Preventive Model for Hamstring Injuries in Professional Soccer: Learning Algorithms;2024-10-28T19:42:57.831905Z
Modern soccer increasingly places trust in visual analysis and statistics rather than only relying on the human experience. However, soccer is an extraordinarily complex game that no widely accepted quantitative analysis methods exist. The statistics collection and visualization are time consuming which result in numerous adjustments. To tackle this issue, we developed GreenSea, a visual-based assessment system designed for soccer game analysis, tactics, and training. The system uses a broad learning system (BLS) to train the model in order to avoid the time-consuming issue that traditional deep learning may suffer. Users are able to apply multiple views of a soccer game, and visual summarization of essential statistics using advanced visualization and animation that are available. A marking system trained by BLS is designed to perform quantitative analysis. A novel recurrent discriminative BLS (RDBLS) is proposed to carry out long-term tracking. In our RDBLS, the structure is adjusted to have better performance on the binary classification problem of the discriminative model. Several experiments are carried out to verify that our proposed RDBLS model can outperform the standard BLS and other methods. Two studies were conducted to verify the effectiveness of our GreenSea. The first study was on how GreenSea assists a youth training coach to assess each trainee's performance for selecting most potential players. The second study was on how GreenSea was used to help the U20 Shanghai soccer team coaching staff analyze games and make tactics during the 13th National Games. Our studies have shown the usability of GreenSea and the values of our system to both amateur and expert users.;73;1;Innovative Technologies;2024-10-28T19:43:06.539773Z;https://doi.org/10.1109/tcyb.2020.2988792;https://openalex.org/W3027374032;Discriminative model, Texture Analysis, Deep Learning, Autofocusing;8.597;Fabric Defect Detection in Industrial Applications;GreenSea: Visual Soccer Analysis Using Broad Learning System;2024-10-28T19:43:06.539794Z
Spectators frequently harass female soccer players, and women's soccer is frequently compared negatively to men's soccer by writers who make the comparison without the backing of any data and without taking into account anthropometric and physiological differences between the sexes. This affects female soccer players' self-confidence negatively and contributes to an undeservedly negative image of women's soccer. In the present paper, we argue that most differences between men's and women's soccer can be explained by women having to adapt to rules and regulations that are suited for men and their physical attributes. Thus, games are much more demanding for women. Furthermore, we argue that if men had to play with a degree of adaptation similar to that which women do today, they would have to alter their style of play radically. As support for our argument, we scale game demands for male and female soccer players according to anthropometric and physiological differences in order to highlight the differences, and use these to predict what would be the most appropriate adaptations. Finally, we show that our predictions are largely supported by the scarce pool of comparable data across the sexes.;74;1;Other;2024-10-28T19:43:49.206926Z;https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00762;https://openalex.org/W2936862293;Soccer Performance, Sport Psychology, Argument (complex analysis);42.52;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;Scaling Demands of Soccer According to Anthropometric and Physiological Sex Differences: A Fairer Comparison of Men’s and Women’s Soccer;2024-10-28T19:43:49.206951Z
"Background: Female soccer players are particularly susceptible to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, accounting for 16% to 43% of the injury burden during the season. Despite the advancements in injury prevention programs, the rate of ACL injuries continues to rise. Purpose: To provide a comprehensive description of the mechanisms, situational pattern, and biomechanics of ACL injuries in women’s soccer. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: We identified 57 consecutive ACL injuries that occurred in matches of 6 top female leagues across 3 seasons (2017-2020). A total of 35 (61%) injury videos were analyzed for the mechanism and situational pattern, while biomechanical analysis was possible in 29 cases. Three independent reviewers evaluated each video. The distribution of ACL injuries according to month, timing within the match, and field location at the time of injury was also reported. Results: In the 35 injury videos, there were 19 (54%) noncontact injuries, 12 (34%) indirect contact injuries, and 4 (11%) direct contact injuries. We identified 3 main situations in players who suffered a noncontact/indirect contact injury: (1) pressing and tackling (n = 18), (2) regaining balance after kicking (n = 7), and (3) being tackled (n = 4). Biomechanical analysis indicated multiplanar mechanisms with frequent knee valgus loading (88%). Additionally, 64% of injuries occurred in the first half of matches and most frequently within the first 30 minutes. Conclusion: Female athletes showed remarkable similarities with elite male players in terms of the ACL mechanism and situational pattern of injury, and 88% of injuries involved no direct contact to the knee, with noncontact injuries being highly prevalent. Injuries occurred during 3 main situations, with accompanying alterations in multiplanar biomechanics. Interventions aimed at reducing ACL injuries in women’s soccer should consider high-intensity defensive play at the beginning of a match. Instruction in the 3 main situations should be applied alongside appropriate neuromuscular training interventions.";75;1;Medical / Injuries;2024-10-28T19:44:13.815730Z;https://doi.org/10.1177/03635465211008169;https://openalex.org/W3161028274;ACL injury, Knee Biomechanics, Anterior Cruciate Ligament, Injury Risk, Biomechanical Analysis, Athlete Monitoring;24.498;Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries in Athletes;Systematic Video Analysis of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries in Professional Female Soccer Players;2024-10-28T19:44:13.815751Z

"No studies have assessed whether changes in physical performance and inter-limb asymmetries (ILA) can be achieved with the FIFA 11+ prevention programme in adolescent female soccer players. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the FIFA 11+ programme compared with a standard warm-up on physical performance and ILA in adolescent female soccer players. Thirty-six adolescent female soccer players were randomly assigned to an experimental (EG; n = 19) or a control group (CG; n = 17). Unilateral/bilateral countermovement jump (CMJ), drop jump (DJ) and horizontal jump tests, two different change of direction tests, an ankle dorsiflexion test, the Y-Balance test (YBT) and inter-limb asymmetries were measured before and after 10 weeks of training. The results revealed no significant group-by-time interactions in the vast majority of variables (p>0.05). Paired t-test revealed significant improvements of the right [effect size (ES):0.56] and left (ES:0.49) CMJ, right (ES:0.74) and left (ES:0.54) DJ (ES:0.74), right (ES:1.27) and left (ES:1.26) posteromedial direction and right (ES:0.89) and left (ES:0.84) posterolateral direction in the YBT in the EG (p < 0.05). Right anterior direction in the YBT and V-cut test were significantly improved in both groups (p<0.05). For inter-limb asymmetry variables, no significant group-by-time interactions (ES:0 to 0.93) and an improvement between pre- and post-tests (ES:-0.76 to 0.49) were observed. Therefore, the FIFA 11+ programme led to improved unilateral jumping, dynamic balance and reduced lower extremity symmetries of several tests in adolescent female soccer players.";77;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T19:45:42.626496Z;https://doi.org/10.5114/biolsport.2019.85453;https://openalex.org/W2951715674;Soccer Performance, Athlete Monitoring, Youth Athletes, Match play;73.942;Epidemiology of Sports-Related Musculoskeletal Injuries;Adolescent female soccer players’ soccer-specific warm-up effects on performance and inter-limb asymmetries;2024-10-28T19:45:42.626517Z
Context : Infrared thermography has been used to detect skeletal muscle overload and fatigue in athletes, but its use in injury prevention in professional soccer has not been studied to date. Objectives : To establish a novel injury prevention program based on infrared thermography and to determine its influence on the injury incidence in professional soccer players in the preseason. Design : A cross-sectional, prospective study design was used to compare a conventional injury prevention program (CPP) applied over the first preseason and an infrared thermography injury prevention program (IRTPP) carried out in the following preseason. Setting : Soccer training ground. Participants : Twenty-four players belonging to a first division soccer team from Spain. Main Outcome Measures : Injury incidences of each player were recorded according to the Orchard Sports Injury Classification System (version 10.0) convention to determine the injury classification, location, and type. Results : The incidence of injuries decreased from 15 injuries in the CPP preseason (0.63 [0.77] injuries per player) to 6 injuries in the second preseason when the IRTPP was applied (0.25 [0.53] injuries per player). The days of absence due to injuries also decreased from the CPP preseason (156 d, 10.4 [11.0] d per injury) to the IRTPP preseason (14 d, 2.3 [2.8] d per injury). The injury severity also decreased from the first preseason to the second preseason, and fewer musculoskeletal injuries in the thigh, hip, and groin were reported. Conclusions : The implementation of an IRTPP can reduce the presence of injuries by identifying players potentially at risk and as a result, reducing the injury severity and days lost as a consequence.;78;1;Medical / Injuries;2024-10-28T19:46:00.628990Z;https://doi.org/10.1123/jsr.2019-0056;https://openalex.org/W3010893006;Thermography, Infrared Thermography, Injury Prevention, Sports Injury;17.89;Medical Applications of Infrared Thermography;Infrared Thermography Protocol on Reducing the Incidence of Soccer Injuries;2024-10-28T19:46:00.629010Z

"The aim of this study was to compare the agreement of the movement demands data during a soccer match (total distance, distance per minute, average speed, maximum speed and distance covered in different speed sectors) between an optical tracking system (Mediacoach System) and a GPS device (Wimu Pro). Participants were twenty-six male professional soccer players (age: 21.65 ± 2.03 years; height: 180.00 ± 7.47 cm; weight: 73.81 ± 5.65 kg) from FC Barcelona B, of whom were recorded a total of 759 measurements during 38 official matches in the Spanish second division. The Mediacoach System and the Wimu Pro were compared using the standardized mean bias, standard error of estimate, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), coefficient of variation (%), and the regression equation to estimate data for each variable. In terms of agreement between systems, the magnitude of the ICC was almost perfect (> 0.90–1.00) for all variables analyzed. The coefficient of the variations between devices was close to zero (< 5%) for total distance, distance per minute, average speed, maximum speed, and walking and jogging, and between 9% and 15% for running, intense running, and sprinting at low and at high intensities. It can be observed that, compared to Wimu Pro the Mediacoach System slightly overestimated all the variables analyzed except for average speed, maximum speed, and walking variables. In conclusion, both systems can be used, and the information they provide in the analyzed variables can be interchanged, with the benefits implied for practitioners and researchers.";80;1;Innovative Technologies;2024-10-28T19:46:21.480455Z;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0220729;https://openalex.org/W2967974147;Soccer Performance, Athlete Monitoring, Variables, Coefficient of variation;6.124;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;A comparison of a GPS device and a multi-camera video technology during official soccer matches: Agreement between systems;2024-10-28T19:46:21.480477Z
"<h3>Importance</h3> Neurodegenerative disease mortality is higher among former professional soccer players than general population controls. However, the factors contributing to increased neurodegenerative disease mortality in this population remain uncertain. <h3>Objective</h3> To investigate the association of field position, professional career length, and playing era with risk of neurodegenerative disease among male former professional soccer players. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> This cohort study used population-based health record linkage in Scotland to evaluate risk among 7676 male former professional soccer players born between January 1, 1900, and January 1, 1977, and 23 028 general population control individuals matched by year of birth, sex, and area socioeconomic status providing 1 812 722 person-years of follow-up. Scottish Morbidity Record and death certification data were available from January 1, 1981, to December 31, 2016, and prescribing data were available from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2016. Database interrogation was performed on December 10, 2018, and data were analyzed between April 2020 and May 2021. <h3>Exposures</h3> Participation in men’s soccer at a professional level. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Outcomes were obtained by individual-level record linkage to national electronic records of mental health and general hospital inpatient and day-case admissions as well as prescribing information and death certification. Risk of neurodegenerative disease was evaluated between former professional soccer players and matched general population control individuals. <h3>Results</h3> In this cohort study of 30 704 male individuals, 386 of 7676 former soccer players (5.0%) and 366 of 23 028 matched population control individuals (1.6%) were identified with a neurodegenerative disease diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR], 3.66; 95% CI, 2.88-4.65;<i>P</i> &lt; .001). Compared with the risk among general population control individuals, risk of neurodegenerative disease was highest for defenders (HR, 4.98; 95% CI, 3.18-7.79;<i>P</i> &lt; .001) and lowest for goalkeepers (HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 0.93-3.60;<i>P</i> = .08). Regarding career length, risk was highest among former soccer players with professional career lengths longer than 15 years (HR, 5.20; 95% CI, 3.17-8.51;<i>P</i> &lt; .001). Regarding playing era, risk remained similar for all players born between 1910 and 1969. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> The differences in risk of neurodegenerative disease observed in this cohort study imply increased risk with exposure to factors more often associated with nongoalkeeper positions, with no evidence this association has changed over the era studied. While investigations to confirm specific factors contributing to increased risk of neurodegenerative disease among professional soccer players are required, strategies directed toward reducing head impact exposure may be advisable in the meantime.";81;1;Medical / Injuries;2024-10-28T19:46:43.363164Z;https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2021.2403;https://openalex.org/W3187743742;Sports-related, Record linkage;21.784;Epidemiology and Impact of Traumatic Brain Injury;Association of Field Position and Career Length With Risk of Neurodegenerative Disease in Male Former Professional Soccer Players;2024-10-28T19:46:43.363183Z
Abstract Virtual reality (VR) provides the potential for immersive and engaging training solutions for improving sport performance. However, if VR training is to be adopted and used in an effective and evidence-based fashion, a more rigorous assessment of the validity of the simulation is required. Construct validity is the degree to which the simulation provides an accurate representation of core features of the task. In the context of sport, if the training drills in the VR environment are a true representation of the skills needed in the real world, then those that excel at the sport in the real world should also excel in the virtual one. In this experiment, we examined the construct validity of a soccer-specific VR simulator by recruiting professional, academy, and novice players. Seventeen participants in each group completed four VR soccer drills, and the VR software provided scores relating to performance and process (e.g., passing accuracy, composure, reaction time, and adaptability). Based on these scores, an algorithm gave a diagnostic score relating to the predicted ability of the player. Results showed that this VR platform successfully differentiated between participants of differing skill levels. These results provide some support for the construct validity of this VR simulator and suggest at least partial overlap between the perceptual-cognitive and motor skills needed to perform well across ‘real’ and virtual environments. Further work is needed to explore the validity and fidelity of the simulation before its adoption as a training device can be fully endorsed.;82;1;Medical / Injuries;2024-10-28T19:49:11.413892Z;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10055-020-00441-x;https://openalex.org/W3014393638;Coaching Effectiveness, Soccer Performance;147.908;Development of Expert Performance in Sports Psychology;Testing the construct validity of a soccer-specific virtual reality simulator using novice, academy, and professional soccer players;2024-10-28T19:49:11.413910Z
"Research has demonstrated that induced mental fatigue impairs soccer-specific technical, tactical and physical performance in soccer players. The findings are limited by the lack of elite players and low ecological validity of the tasks used to induce mental fatigue, which do not resemble the cognitive demands of soccer. The current study collected survey data from English academy soccer players (n = 256; age groups - U14 - U23), with questions comprising of five themes (descriptors of physical and mental fatigue, travel, education, match-play and fixture congestion). The survey consisted of multiple choice responses, checkboxes and blinded/unblinded (for duration based questions) 0-100 arbitrary unit (AU) slider scales. Listening to music (81.6% of players), using social media (58.3%) and watching videos (34.3%) were the most common pre-match activities. Pre-match subjective mental fatigue was low (18.7±18.8 AU), and most frequently reported at the end of a match (47±26 AU) and remained elevated 24-hours post-match (36±27 AU). Travel (29±24 AU), fixture congestion (44±25 AU) and education (30±26 AU) demonstrated a low to moderate presence of subjective mental fatigue. These findings provide an overview of activities performed by English academy soccer players pre-match, and demonstrate that mental fatigue is experienced as a result of match-play.";83;1;Psychology;2024-10-28T19:49:18.923763Z;https://doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2020.1746597;https://openalex.org/W3013499517;Mental fatigue, Sport Psychology, Coaching Effectiveness, Soccer Performance, Exercise Motivation, Training Load;7.393;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;Understanding the presence of mental fatigue in English academy soccer players;2024-10-28T19:49:18.923786Z
The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between basic cognitive functions and sport-specific motor skills in elite youth soccer players. A total of 15 elite youth soccer players aged 11-13 years performed a computer-based test battery measuring the attention window (AW), perceptual load (PL), working memory capacity (WMC), and multiple object tracking (MOT). Another set of tests was used to asses speed abilities and football-specific technical skills (sprint, change of direction, dribbling, ball control, shooting, juggling). Spearman’s correlation tests showed that the diagonal AW was positively associated with dribbling skills (rs = .656) which indicates that a broader AW could be beneficial for highly demanding motor skills like dribbling. WMC was positively related to dribbling (rs = .562), ball control (rs = .669) and ball juggling (rs = .727). Additionally, the cumulated score of all cognitive tests was positively related to the cumulated motor test score (rs = .614) which supports the interplay of physical and psychological skills. Our findings highlight the need for more and especially longitudinal studies to enhance the knowledge of cognition-motor skill relationships for talent identification, talent development, and performance in soccer.;84;1;Psychology;2024-10-28T19:51:36.241247Z;https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00817;https://openalex.org/W2924014003;Sprint, Youth Sport Specialization, Soccer Performance, Sport Psychology, Coaching Effectiveness, Athlete Development, Cognitive skill, Football players;137.166;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;The Relationship Between Cognitive Functions and Sport-Specific Motor Skills in Elite Youth Soccer Players;2024-10-28T19:51:36.241269Z
Increasing interest, enthusiasm of sport lovers, and economics involved offer high importance to sports video recording and analysis. Being crucial for decision making, ball detection and tracking in soccer has become a challenging research area. This paper presents a novel deep learning approach for 2D ball detection and tracking (DLBT) in soccer videos posing various challenges. A new 2-stage buffer median filtering background modelling is used for moving objects blob detection. A deep learning approach for classification of an image patch into three classes, i.e. ball, player, and background is initially proposed. Probabilistic bounding box overlapping technique is proposed further for robust ball track validation. Novel full and boundary grid concepts resume tracking in ball_track_lost and ball_out_of_frame situations. DLBT does not require human intervention to identify ball from the initial frames unlike the most published algorithms. DLBT yields extraordinary accurate and robust tracking results compared to the other contemporary 2D trackers even in presence of various challenges including very small ball size and fast movements.;85;1;Innovative Technologies;2024-10-28T19:51:52.915848Z;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.opelre.2019.02.003;https://openalex.org/W2921205141;Ball (mathematics), Multiple Object Tracking, Motion Detection, Object Tracking, Visual Tracking, Real-time Tracking;16.56;Automatic Video Summarization and Analysis;A deep learning ball tracking system in soccer videos;2024-10-28T19:51:52.915870Z
"The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of hamstring eccentric (NHE) strength training versus sprint training programmed as complements to regular soccer practice, on sprint performance and its mechanical underpinnings, as well as biceps femoris long head (BFlh) architecture.In this prospective interventional control study, sprint performance, sprint mechanics and BFlh architecture variables were compared before versus after six weeks of training during the first six preseason weeks, and between three different random match-pair groups of soccer players: ""Soccer group"" (n = 10), ""Nordic group"" (n = 12) and ""Sprint group"" (n = 10).For sprint performance and mechanics, small to large pre-post improvements were reported in ""Sprint group"" (except maximal running velocity), whereas only trivial to small negative changes were reported in ""Soccer group"" and ""Nordic group"". For BFlh architecture variables, ""Sprint"" group showed moderate increase in fascicle length compared to smaller augment for the ""Nordic"" group with trivial changes for ""Soccer group"". Only ""Nordic"" group presented small increases at pennation angle.The results suggest that sprint training was superior to NHE in order to increase BFlh fascicle length although only the sprint training was able to both provide a preventive stimulus (increase fascicle length) and at the same time improve both sprint performance and mechanics. Further studies with advanced imaging techniques are needed to confirm the validity of the findings.";86;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T19:52:00.381076Z;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228283;https://openalex.org/W3005908503;Sprint, Muscle architecture, Training Load, Athletic Training, High-Intensity Interval Training, Soccer Performance, Athlete Monitoring;7.354;Epidemiology of Sports-Related Musculoskeletal Injuries;Sprint versus isolated eccentric training: Comparative effects on hamstring architecture and performance in soccer players;2024-10-28T19:52:00.381096Z
"Synopsis This paper is part 2 of a 2-part series aimed at discussing the key elements of on-field rehabilitation training. In part 1, we described 4 pillars underpinning high-quality on-field rehabilitation: (1) restoring movement quality, (2) physical conditioning, (3) restoring sport-specific skills, and (4) progressively developing chronic training load. In part 2, we describe how the pillars contribute to a 5-stage on-field rehabilitation program to help injured players transition to team practice and match play. We use the example of a soccer player with ambitions to return to sport after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The program moves through 5 field-based training stages: (1) linear movement, (2) multidirectional movement, (3) soccer-specific technical skills, (4) soccer-specific movement, and (5) practice simulation. The staged program is research based and facilitates communication, planning, control, and safety in return to sport following long-term injury.

Soccer is a dynamic sport of high unpredictability that requires appropriate decision making for success, but intervening factors such as exposure time to smartphone applications can lead to a decline in cognitive performance and consequently in psychomotor tasks. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of exposure time to smartphone applications on the passing decision-making performance in professional soccer athletes. The participants were 20 soccer athletes aged 18–35 years (M = 24.7 ± 3.6). This study was a controlled and randomized experimental within-subject investigation, consisting of four visits with a 1-week interval. Male soccer athletes participated in four randomized conditions throughout the four visits: control (CON), 15-min smartphone (15SMA), 30-min smartphone (30SMA), and 45-min smartphone (45SMA). The Stroop Task assessed the level of induced mental fatigue before and after each experimental condition. Then, the athletes played a simulated soccer game. The game was filmed for further analysis of passing decision-making performance. A condition effect (p < .001) was identified for passing decision-making performance, with impairment in 30SMA (p = .01, h2 = 0.6) and 45SMA (p = .01, h2 = 0.6) conditions. We conclude that at least 30 min of smartphone application exposure caused mental fatigue, which impaired passing decision-making performance in male soccer athletes.;88;1;Other;2024-10-28T20:08:46.938957Z;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychsport.2019.05.001;https://openalex.org/W2943139210;Stroop effect, Exercise, Physical Activity, Smartphone application;905.632;Effects of Physical Activity on Health Outcomes;Effect of exposure time to smartphone apps on passing decision-making in male soccer athletes;2024-10-28T20:08:46.938976Z
"Abstract Bishop, C, Brashill, C, Abbott, W, Read, P, Lake, J, and Turner, A. Jumping asymmetries are associated with speed, change of direction speed, and jump performance in elite academy soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 35(7): 1841–1847, 2021—The aim of this study was to establish interlimb asymmetries across different age groups in elite academy male soccer players and to examine any relationships between asymmetry and measures of physical performance. Fifty-one players from an English Premier League soccer academy were split into under-23 ( n = 21), under-18 ( n = 14), and under-16 ( n = 16) groups and performed bilateral and unilateral countermovement jumps, 5-, 10-, and 20-m sprints, and a 505 change of direction speed tests. All tests showed low variability (coefficient of variation ≤ 2.5%) and good to excellent reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.80–0.99). A 1-way analysis of variance showed that the under-23 group was significantly faster than the under-16 group during the 20-m sprint (2.90 vs. 2.98 s; p = 0.02; effect size = 0.94). No other significant differences were present between groups. Interlimb asymmetry was quantified from the single-leg countermovement jump, and no significant differences in the magnitude of asymmetry were present between groups. However, multiple significant correlations were present in each age group between asymmetry and physical performance tests, all of which were indicative of reduced athletic performance. Results from this study show that although interlimb asymmetry scores are comparable across age groups in elite academy soccer players, differences as low as 5% are associated with reduced physical performance during jumping, sprinting, and change of direction speed tasks. This study suggests the importance of monitoring jump height asymmetries in elite academy soccer players.";89;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T20:10:11.663493Z;https://doi.org/10.1519/jsc.0000000000003058;https://openalex.org/W2915005917;Sprint, Soccer Performance, Athlete Development, Countermovement, Sport Psychology, Athlete Monitoring, Coaching Effectiveness, Elite, Coefficient of variation, Vertical jump;84.612;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;Jumping Asymmetries Are Associated With Speed, Change of Direction Speed, and Jump Performance in Elite Academy Soccer Players;2024-10-28T20:10:11.663514Z
The paper presents plus–minus ratings for use in association football (soccer). We first describe the general plus–minus methodology as used in basketball and ice-hockey and then adapt it for use in soccer. The usual goal-differential plus–minus is considered before two new variations are proposed. For the first variation, we present a methodology to calculate an expected goals plus–minus rating. The second variation makes use of in-play probabilities of match outcome to evaluate an expected points plus–minus rating. We use the ratings to examine who are the best players in European football, and demonstrate how the players’ ratings evolve over time. Finally, we shed light on the debate regarding which is the strongest league. The model suggests the English Premier League is the strongest, with the German Bundesliga a close runner-up.;90;1;Tactics analysis;2024-10-28T20:10:58.836629Z;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2019.11.026;https://openalex.org/W2989817580;Ice hockey, Basketball, Variation (astronomy), Soccer Performance;47.06;Economics of Professional Sports and Prediction Markets;Plus–minus player ratings for soccer;2024-10-28T20:10:58.836649Z
We investigate how to learn functions that rate game situations on a soccer pitch according to their potential to lead to successful attacks. We follow a purely data-driven approach using techniques from deep reinforcement learning to valuate multiplayer positionings based on positional data. Empirically, the predicted scores highly correlate with dangerousness of actual situations and show that rating of player positioning without expert knowledge is possible.;91;1;Innovative Technologies;2024-10-28T20:11:08.262154Z;https://doi.org/10.1089/big.2018.0054;https://openalex.org/W2913111658;Soccer Performance, Performance Analysis, Training Load;9.312;Economics of Professional Sports and Prediction Markets;Learning to Rate Player Positioning in Soccer;2024-10-28T20:11:08.262176Z
In video understanding, action spotting consists in temporally localizing human-induced events annotated with single timestamps. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function that specifically considers the temporal context naturally present around each action, rather than focusing on the single annotated frame to spot. We benchmark our loss on a large dataset of soccer videos, SoccerNet, and achieve an improvement of 12.8% over the baseline. We show the generalization capability of our loss for generic activity proposals and detection on ActivityNet, by spotting the beginning and the end of each activity. Furthermore, we provide an extended ablation study and display challenging cases for action spotting in soccer videos. Finally, we qualitatively illustrate how our loss induces a precise temporal understanding of actions and show how such semantic knowledge can be used for automatic highlights generation.;92;1;Innovative Technologies;2024-10-28T20:11:14.311651Z;https://doi.org/10.1109/cvpr42600.2020.01314;https://openalex.org/W3010426832;Spotting, Action Recognition, Event Detection, Video Summarization, Human Activity Analysis, Soccer Video, Benchmark (surveying);5.939;Human Action Recognition and Pose Estimation;A Context-Aware Loss Function for Action Spotting in Soccer Videos;2024-10-28T20:11:14.311673Z
This paper presents a deep learning approach to summarizing long soccer videos by leveraging the spatiotemporal learning capability of three-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) – Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Our proposed approach involves, 1) a step-by-step development of a Residual Network (ResNet) based 3D-CNN that recognizes soccer actions, 2) manually annotating 744 soccer clips from five soccer action classes for training, and 3) training an LSTM network on soccer features extracted by the proposed ResNet based 3D-CNN. We combine the 3D-CNN and LSTM models to detect soccer highlights. To summarize a soccer match video, we model the video input as a sequential concatenation of video segments whose inclusion in a summary video production is based on its validated relevance. To evaluate the proposed summarization system, 10 soccer videos were summarized and subsequently evaluated by 48 participants polled from 8 countries using the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) scale. Collectively, the summarized videos received a 4 of 5 MOS.;93;1;Innovative Technologies;2024-10-28T20:11:19.819445Z;https://doi.org/10.1109/mipr.2019.00055;https://openalex.org/W2941763386;Video Summarization, Soccer Video, Deep Learning, Video Analysis, Concatenation (mathematics), Relevance (law);5.396;Automatic Video Summarization and Analysis;Soccer Video Summarization Using Deep Learning;2024-10-28T20:11:19.819465Z
"High-speed running and sprinting training play an important role in the development of physical capabilities, sport-specific performance and injury prevention among soccer players. This commentary aims to summarize the current evidence regarding high-speed running and sprinting training in professional soccer and to inform its implementation in research and applied settings. It is structured into four sections: 1) Evidence-based high-speed running and sprinting conditioning methodologies; 2) Monitoring of high-speed running and sprinting performance in soccer 3) Recommendations for effective implementation of high-speed running and sprinting training in applied soccer settings; 4) Limitations and future directions. The contemporary literature provides preliminary methodological guidelines for coaches and practitioners. The recommended methods to ensure high-speed running and sprinting exposure for both conditioning purposes and injury prevention strategies among soccer players are: high-intensity running training, field-based drills and ball-drills in the form of medium- and large-sided games. Global navigation satellite systems are valid and reliable technologies for high-speed running and sprinting monitoring practice. Future research is required to refine, and advance training practices aimed at optimizing individual high-speed running and sprinting training responses and associated long-term effects.";94;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T20:11:24.941319Z;https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1302-7968;https://openalex.org/W3102780378;Soccer Performance, High-Intensity Interval Training, Training Load, Physical Conditioning, Athlete Monitoring;5.012;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;Implementing High-speed Running and Sprinting Training in Professional Soccer;2024-10-28T20:11:24.941338Z
"The aim of this study was two-fold: (i) to describe the training/match ratios of different external load measures during a full professional soccer season while analyzing the variations between different types of weeks (three, four and five training sessions/week) and (ii) to investigate the relationship between weekly accumulated training loads and the match demands of the same week. Twenty-seven professional soccer players (24.9 ± 3.5 years old) were monitored daily using a 10-Hz global positioning system with a 100-Hz accelerometer. Total distance (TD), running distance (RD), high-speed running (HSR), sprinting distance (SD), player load (PL), number of high accelerations (ACC), and number of high decelerations (DEC) were recorded during training sessions and matches. An individual training/match ratio (TMr) was calculated for each external load measure. Weeks with five training sessions (5dW) presented meaningfully greater TMr than weeks with four (4dW) or three (3dW) training sessions. Additionally, TDratio (TDr) was significantly greater in 5dW than in 3dW (mean differences dif: 1.23 arbitray units A.U.) and 4dW (dif: 0.80 A.U.); HSRr was significantly greater in 5dW than in 3dW (dif: 0.90 A.U.) and 4dW (dif: 0.68 A.U.); and SDr was significantly greater in 5dW than in 3dW (dif: 0.77 A.U.) and 4dW (dif: 0.90 A.U.). Correlations between the weekly training loads and the match demands of the same week were small for PL (r = 0.250 [0.13;0.36]), ACC (r = 0.292 [0.17;0.40]) and DEC (r = 0.236 [0.11;0.35]). This study reveals that ratios of above 1 were observed for specific measures (e.g., HSR, SD). It was also observed that training sessions are not adjusted according to weekly variations in match demands.";95;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T20:11:48.091797Z;https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16173057;https://openalex.org/W2969949682;Match play, Training Load, Soccer Performance, Athlete Monitoring, Physical Conditioning, High-Intensity Interval Training, Running economy;23.04;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;Training/Match External Load Ratios in Professional Soccer Players: A Full-Season Study;2024-10-28T20:11:48.091818Z
"<h3>Importance</h3> Because of the negative consequences of concussion, considerable research efforts have been directed toward understanding the risk factors for sport-related concussion (SRC) and its outcomes to better inform strategies for risk reduction. Girls are suggested to have an increased risk of concussion, warranting exploration into sex-dependent variations in concussion presentation and management, with the potential that this information might inform sex-specific rules directed toward risk reduction within sports. <h3>Objective</h3> To compare sex-associated differences in epidemiology and concussion management in adolescent soccer players within a prospective, longitudinal high school injury surveillance project. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> This prospective, longitudinal cohort study assessed male and female soccer athletes from all high schools in the Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) during academic years 2016-2017 to 2018-2019. <h3>Exposures</h3> Sport-related concussion captured in the MHSAA Head Injury Reporting System. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Outcomes included details regarding each documented SRC event, including injury mechanism, immediate management, and return-to-play time. Multiple comparisons were made between male and female athletes regarding SRC risk, mechanism, short-term management, and outcomes. <h3>Results</h3> A total of 43 741 male and 39 637 female soccer athletes participated in MHSAA soccer during the 3 consecutive academic years of study (2016-2017: n = 751 schools; 2017-2018: n = 750 schools; and 2018-2019: n = 747 schools). During the 3 years of surveillance, 1507 of the 83 378 soccer athletes (1.8%) were reported to have SRC during soccer participation, including 557 boys (37.0%) and 950 girls (63.0%). Documented SRC risk in female soccer participants was greater than in male soccer participants (risk ratio, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.69-2.09;<i>P</i> &lt; .001). Male soccer athletes most often sustained SRC from contact with another player (48.4%), whereas SRCs in female soccer players recorded in the Head Injury Reporting System were most often from nonplayer contact events (41.9%;<i>P</i> &lt; .001). Adolescent male soccer players with a documented SRC were more likely to be removed from play on the day of injury (odds ratio, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.15-2.06;<i>P</i> = .004). Although the overall median time to return to play was 11 days (interquartile range [IQR], 7-15 days), male athletes typically returned 2 days earlier than female athletes (median, 10 [IQR, 7-14] days vs 12 [IQR, 7-16] days; Peto test<i>P</i> &lt; .001). <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> In this cohort study, sex-associated differences were revealed among adolescent soccer athletes in SRC risk, mechanism of injury, immediate management, and outcomes in injuries documented in a statewide injury reporting system. Thus, consideration might be given to sex-specific approaches to participation and concussion management in the sport.";96;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T20:12:31.838311Z;https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.8191;https://openalex.org/W3158980885;Concussion, Sports-related, Association (psychology), Longitudinal study;43.6;Epidemiology and Impact of Traumatic Brain Injury;Association of Sex With Adolescent Soccer Concussion Incidence and Characteristics;2024-10-28T20:12:31.838331Z
"Abstract The purpose of this study was to analyze the day-to-day variance of a typical weekly external training workload of two professional soccer teams from different countries. Twenty-nine players from two professional teams from Portugal and the Netherlands participated in this study. The players’ external load was monitored for 7 weeks, by means of portable GPS devices (10 Hz, JOHAN, Noordwijk, Netherlands). Results revealed that match day -1 (MD-1), i.e. the training day before a match, had significantly (p = 0.001) less training volume (4584.50 m) than the other days. MD-5 (training five days before a match), MD-4 (four days before a match) and MD-3 (three days before a match) were the most intense (390.83, 176.90 and 247.32 m of sprinting distance, respectively) and with large volume (7062.66, 6077.30 and 6919.49 m, respectively). Interestingly, significant differences were found between clubs of different countries (p &lt; 0.05) with the Portuguese team showing significantly higher intensity (sprinting distance) and volume (total distance) in all days with exception of MD-1 than the Dutch team. The results of this study possibly allow for the identification of different training workloads and tapering strategies between countries in relation to volume and intensity. It should be noted, however, that both clubs used a significant tapering phase in the last two days before the competition in an attempt to reduce residual fatigue accumulation.";97;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T20:13:09.133343Z;https://doi.org/10.2478/hukin-2018-0054;https://openalex.org/W2933450286;Tapering, Training Load, Soccer Performance, Athlete Monitoring;37.145;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;Characterization of the Weekly External Load Profile of Professional Soccer Teams From Portugal and the Netherlands;2024-10-28T20:13:09.133362Z
"Objectives: previous studies investigating the ability of isokinetic strength ratios to predict hamstring injuries in soccer players have reported conflicting results. Hypothesis: to determine if isokinetic ratios are able to predict hamstring injury occurring during the season in professional soccer players.Study Design: case-control study; Level of evidence: 3. Methods: from 2001 to 2011, 350 isokinetic tests were performed in 136 professional soccer players at the beginning of the soccer season.Fifty-seven players suffered hamstring injury during the season that followed the isokinetic tests.These players were compared with the 79 uninjured players.The bilateral concentric ratio (hamstring-to-hamstring), ipsilateral concentric ratio (hamstring-toquadriceps), and mixed ratio (eccentric/concentric hamstring-to-quadriceps) were studied.The predictive ability of each ratio was established based on the likelihood ratio and post-test probability.Results: the mixed ratio (30 eccentric/240 concentric hamstring-to-quadriceps) <0.8, ipsilateral ratio (180 concentric hamstring-to-quadriceps) <0.47, and bilateral ratio (60 concentric hamstring-to-hamstring) <0.85 were the most predictive of hamstring injury.The ipsilateral ratio <0.47 allowed prediction of the severity of the hamstring injury, and was also influenced by the length of time since administration of the isokinetic tests.Conclusion: isokinetic ratios are useful for predicting the likelihood of hamstring injury in professional soccer players during the competitive season.";98;1;Medical / Injuries;2024-10-28T20:13:13.699355Z;https://doi.org/10.32098/mltj.01.2016.14;https://openalex.org/W4256736850;Hamstring Strain, Soccer Performance, Athlete Monitoring, Sports Injury, High-Intensity Interval Training, Hamstring injury;4.455;Epidemiology of Sports-Related Musculoskeletal Injuries;Prediction of hamstring injury in professional soccer players by isokinetic measurements;2024-10-28T20:13:13.699380Z
Participation in youth soccer in the United States continues to increase steadily, with a greater percentage of preadolescent participants than perhaps any other youth sport. Despite the wide-ranging health benefits of participation in organized sports, injuries occur and represent a threat to the health and performance of young athletes. Youth soccer has a greater reported injury rate than many other contact sports, and recent studies suggest that injury rates are increasing. Large increases in the incidence of concussions in youth soccer have been reported, and anterior cruciate ligament injuries remain a significant problem in this sport, particularly among female athletes. Considerable new research has identified a number of modifiable risk factors for lower-extremity injuries and concussion, and several prevention programs have been identified to reduce the risk of injury. Rule enforcement and fair play also serve an important role in reducing the risk of injury among youth soccer participants. This report provides an updated review of the relevant literature as well as recommendations to promote the safe participation of children and adolescents in soccer.;99;1;Medical / Injuries;2024-10-28T20:13:16.921293Z;https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2019-2759;https://openalex.org/W2981594716;Sports Injury, Youth Athletes, Soccer Performance;3.11;Epidemiology of Sports-Related Musculoskeletal Injuries;Soccer Injuries in Children and Adolescents;2024-10-28T20:13:16.921332Z

Influence of situational variables, team formation, and playing position on match running performance and social network analysis of brazilian professional soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 34(3): 808–817, 2020—The purpose of this study was to investigate the independent and interactive effects of situational variables, opposition team formation, and playing position on running performance and network analysis in Brazilian professional soccer players ( n = 22). Global positioning system technology was used to determine total distance covered, mean speed, maximum running speed, and distance covered in 6 speed ranges. Social network analysis was used to assess interpersonal coordination (team interactions characterized as successful passes [ n = 3,033] between teammates). Observations of match running performance ( n = 129) and network analysis ( n = 108) were obtained. The main results were: (a) no interactive effects between team formation and playing position were observed for running and network variables (unclear to possibly); (b) matches played at home or against “weaker” opponents presented greater running demands and individual/global metrics of network analysis (likely to almost certain); (c) match outcome demonstrated influence only for running performance; matches in which the reference team won resulted in higher values than in matches lost; (d) when the reference team competed in 1-4-4-2 formation, this resulted in greater running demands than 1-4-2-3-1 formation (likely to almost certain); (e) reduced values of running performance variables were reported in central defenders compared with other positions. Central/external midfielders reported greater closeness/betweenness centrality, outdegree, and eigenvector compared with central/external defenders and forwards (likely to almost certain).

Coronavirus disease-19 quarantine is more detrimental than traditional off-season on physical conditioning of professional soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 34(12): 3316–3320, 2020—Beyond the severe health crisis, the coronavirus disease 2019 has also affected the high-performance sports scenario. In soccer, practitioners are concerned about the effects of long-term detraining on players' conditioning, and caution is required when activities return. This study assessed body composition, jump and sprint performance, hamstring eccentric strength, and intermittent cardiorespiratory fitness of 23 male professional soccer players who returned to training activities after 63 days of quarantine. The results were compared with their physical condition assessed before a pre-season phase as soon as they returned to training after a regular 24-day off-season period. In comparison with after off-season assessments, the quarantine induced significant increases in body mass, body fat mass, 10- and 20-m sprint times as well as decreases in countermovement jump height ( p &lt; 0.05). There were no significant changes in hamstring eccentric strength, squat jump height, and cardiorespiratory fitness ( p &gt; 0.05). In summary, we showed that 63 days of quarantine impaired several physical performance measures compared with regular off-season in soccer players. Given the present results, special attention should be given to body composition–related and speed power–related capabilities after long-term detraining in professional soccer.";101;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T20:14:10.039132Z;https://doi.org/10.1519/jsc.0000000000003890;https://openalex.org/W3096944395;Sprint, Soccer Performance;8.172;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;Coronavirus Disease-19 Quarantine Is More Detrimental Than Traditional Off-Season on Physical Conditioning of Professional Soccer Players;2024-10-28T20:14:10.039155Z
"There has recently been an increase in quantification and objective analysis of soccer performance due to improvements in technology using load indexes such as Player Load (PL) and Metabolic Power (MP). The objectives of this study were: (1) to describe the performance of PL and MP in competition according to the specific role, match-to- match variation, periods of play, game location and match status according to game periods, and (2) to analyze the relationship between both indexes. Twenty-one national-level soccer players were distributed in the following specific positional roles: external defenders (ED) (n = 4), central defenders (CD) (n = 4), midfielders (M) (n = 5), external midfielders (EM) (n = 4) and attackers (A) (n = 4). A total of 12 matches played by a Spanish Third Division team during the 2016/2017 season were analyzed. WIMU PROTM inertial devices (RealTrack System, Almeria, Spain) were used for recording the data. The main results were: (1) a performance reduction in both variables over the course of match time, (2) significant differences in both variables based on the specific position, (3) differences in physical demands during the season matches, (4) winning during a game period and the condition of being the visitor team provoked higher demands, and (5) a high correlation between both variables in soccer. In conclusion, different contextual variables influence the external load demands; both indexes are related so they could be used for external load quantification, and it is necessary to analyze physical demands of the competition for a specific and individualized load design in training sessions.";102;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T20:15:16.495946Z;https://doi.org/10.2478/hukin-2018-0072;https://openalex.org/W2982257098;Soccer Performance, Training Load, Performance Analysis, Exercise Capacity, Athlete Monitoring, Team sport;66.305;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;Player Load and Metabolic Power Dynamics as Load Quantifiers in Soccer;2024-10-28T20:15:16.495966Z
Assessing the impact of the individual actions performed by soccer players during games is a crucial aspect of the player recruitment process. Unfortunately, most traditional metrics fall short in addressing this task as they either focus on rare actions like shots and goals alone or fail to account for the context in which the actions occurred. This paper introduces (1) a new language for describing individual player actions on the pitch and (2) a framework for valuing any type of player action based on its impact on the game outcome while accounting for the context in which the action happened. By aggregating soccer players' action values, their total offensive and defensive contributions to their team can be quantified. We show how our approach considers relevant contextual information that traditional player evaluation metrics ignore and present a number of use cases related to scouting and playing style characterization in the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 seasons in Europe's top competitions.;103;1;Scouting / Finance;2024-10-28T20:15:45.664511Z;;https://openalex.org/W3104053321;Offensive, Soccer Performance, Sport Psychology, Coaching Effectiveness, Performance Analysis;29.053;Economics of Professional Sports and Prediction Markets;Actions Speak Louder than Goals: Valuing Player Actions in Soccer;2024-10-28T20:15:45.664531Z
In soccer, passing is the most frequent interaction between players and plays a significant role in creating scoring chances.Experts are interested in analyzing players passing behavior to learn passing tactics, i.e., how players build up an attack with passing.Various approaches have been proposed to facilitate the analysis of passing tactics.However, the dynamic changes of a teams employed tactics over a match have not been comprehensively investigated.To address the problem, we closely collaborate with domain experts and characterize requirements to analyze the dynamic changes of a teams passing tactics.To characterize the passing tactic employed for each attack, we propose a topic-based approach that provides a high-level abstraction of complex passing behaviors.Based on the model, we propose a glyph-based design to reveal the multi-variate information of passing tactics within different phases of attacks, including player identity, spatial context, and formation.We further design and develop PassVizor, a visual analytics system, to support the comprehensive analysis of passing dynamics.With the system, users can detect the changing patterns of passing tactics and examine the detailed passing process for evaluating passing tactics.We invite experts to conduct analysis with PassVizor and demonstrate the usability of the system through an expert interview.;104;1;Tactics analysis;2024-10-28T20:16:16.887085Z;https://doi.org/10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030359;https://openalex.org/W3092406696;Glyph (data visualization), Abstraction, Soccer Video;31.109;Information Visualization and Visual Data Mining;PassVizor: Toward Better Understanding of the Dynamics of Soccer Passes;2024-10-28T20:16:16.887105Z
"The purpose of this study was to examine the selective influences of the maximum acceleration capability on change of direction (COD) speed, COD deficit, linear sprint speed, sprint momentum, and loaded and unloaded vertical jump performances in forty-nine male professional soccer players (24.3 ± 4.2 years; 75.4 ± 5.4 kg; 177.9 ± 6.4 cm). Soccer players performed the assessments in the following order: 1) squat and countermovement jumps; 2) 20-m sprinting speed test; 3) Zigzag COD ability test; and 4) bar-power outputs in the jump squat exercise. Athletes were divided, using a median split analysis, into two different groups according to their maximum acceleration rates from zero to 5-m (e.g., higher and lower ACC 0-5-m). Magnitude-based inference was used to compare the differences in the physical test results between ""higher"" and ""lower"" acceleration groups. A selective influence of the maximum acceleration ability on speed-power tests was observed, as the higher acceleration group demonstrated likely to almost certain higher performances than the lower acceleration group in all measurements (effect sizes varying from 0.66 [for sprint momentum in 20-m] to 2.39 [for sprint velocity in 5-m]). Conversely, the higher acceleration group demonstrated a higher COD deficit when compared to the lower acceleration group (ES = 0.55). This indicates compromised efficiency to perform COD maneuvers in this group of players. In summary, it was observed that soccer players with higher maximum acceleration rates are equally able to jump higher, sprint faster (over short distances), and achieve higher COD velocities than their slower counterparts. However, they appear to be less efficient at changing direction, which may be related to their reduced ability to deal with greater entry and exit velocities, or counterbalance the associated mechanical consequences (i.e., greater inertia) of being faster and more powerful.";105;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T20:16:33.756613Z;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0216806;https://openalex.org/W2944872864;Sprint, Squat, Soccer Performance, Training Load, Athlete Monitoring, Muscle Adaptations, Physical Conditioning, Vertical jump;16.752;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;Maximum acceleration performance of professional soccer players in linear sprints: Is there a direct connection with change-of-direction ability?;2024-10-28T20:16:33.756636Z

Anthropometric and body composition profile of young professional soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 34(7): 1911-1923, 2020-The purpose was to describe the anthropometric and body composition profile of young professional soccer players and to compare the players profiles between different competitive divisions and playing positions. A retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out with anthropometric data obtained from the records of soccer players of Club Deportivo Guadalajara, S.A. de C.V. (Mexico) in the under-17, under-20, second, third, and fourth division categories. Body mass, height, sitting-height, skinfolds, girths, and bone breadths were measured by certified anthropometrists from September 2011 to March 2015, following the procedures recommended by the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry. Body composition was determined using the 5-way fractionation method. Comparisons between playing positions in each division and between divisions were performed using analysis of variance, and Bonferroni's post-hoc analyses (SPSS version 22 for Windows, p < 0.05 considered as significant). Data from 755 subjects were analyzed. The mean age was 18.1 ± 1.7 years old (minimum 14.8, maximum 23.2). The under-20 division registered higher anthropometric and body composition values than all other competitive divisions. In addition, goalkeepers were taller, heavier, and obtained the highest values for adipose mass, whereas forwards presented higher percentages of muscle mass. These tables can be used during nutritional assessment and nutritional monitoring of players to establish body composition goals. In addition, the strength and conditioning practitioner may also use these data to design effective and specific training programs most suitable to the anthropometric and body composition profile of each player, taking into consideration his competitive division and playing position.;106;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T20:17:07.347852Z;https://doi.org/10.1519/jsc.0000000000003416;https://openalex.org/W3006033593;Soccer Performance, Segmental Body Composition, Athlete Monitoring, Post hoc;33.443;Sports Science and Performance Analysis;Anthropometric and Body Composition Profile of Young Professional Soccer Players;2024-10-28T20:17:07.347874Z
"Fundamental motor skills (FMS) are the basic building blocks of more complex, sport-specific skills and should be mastered at the end of early childhood; however, the relationship between the two has not yet been verified in prepubertal soccer players. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the role of FMS in a process of acquiring soccer-specific motor skills (measured using the speed dribbling) with regard to physical fitness and biological maturation. Forty soccer players (11.5 ± 0.3 years of age) at the highest performance level participated in the study. The role of FMS in a complex theoretical model with the relationships among physical fitness, biological maturation and speed dribbling was analyzed by multiple regression path analyses (MRPA). Moderate-to-strong correlations were found between FMS, physical fitness, and speed dribbling (r = 0.56 – 0.66). Moreover, biological maturation did not appear to be a significant predictor of physical fitness or speed dribbling. The MRPA model of physical fitness on speed dribbling with FMS as a mediator showed a significant indirect effect (standard estimation = -0.31, p = 0.001; R2 = 0.25). However, the direct correlation between physical fitness and speed dribbling was nonsignificant. Our results showed that FMS significantly strengthened the influence of physical fitness on the performance of speed dribbling, a soccer-specific motor skill, and thus played an important role in the process of the acquisition of sport-specific motor skills in prepubertal soccer players. Therefore, when considering the long-term training process, especially during childhood and before puberty, a wide range of FMS activities should be applied for better and possibly faster acquisition of soccer-specific motor skills.";107;1;Physical Attributes;2024-10-28T20:17:17.293607Z;https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.00596;https://openalex.org/W2947570925;Childhood Motor Skills, Fine Motor Skills, Motor Skill Competence, Soccer Performance, Body Communication Skills;9.831;Developmental Perspective on Motor Skill Competence;Fundamental Motor Skills Mediate the Relationship Between Physical Fitness and Soccer-Specific Motor Skills in Young Soccer Players;2024-10-28T20:17:17.293633Z
